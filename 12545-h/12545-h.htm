<p id="d0e111">The following myths were collected by the writer in 1907&#8211;8 during a stay of sixteen months with the Tinguian, a pagan tribe
of northwestern Luzon in the Philippines. The material, for the most part gathered in texts, was partially translated in the
Islands, while the balance was worked over during a brief visit to America in 1909. In this task I was assisted by Dumagat,
a full blood Tinguian, who accompanied me.

</p>
<p id="d0e113">While not, in all cases, giving a literal rendering, I have endeavored to follow closely the language of the story-tellers
rather than to offer a polished translation. In some cases, where it was impossible to record the tales when heard, only the
substance was noted, a fact which will account for the meagerness of detail evident in a few of the stories.

</p>
<p id="d0e115">The Tinguian tribe numbers about twenty thousand individuals, most of whom are found in the sub-province of Abra, and in the
mountains of Ilocos Sur and Norte. Their material culture, beliefs, and ceremonials are quite uniform and exceedingly complex.
It is my intention to publish a study of this people in the near future, but realizing that it will be quite impossible for
readers unacquainted with Tinguian life to understand many references in the tales, I have added such foot notes as will enable
them to grasp the meaning of certain obscure passages.

</p>
<p id="d0e117">In the introduction, an attempt has been made to bring together the culture of the people as it appears in the myths, and
to contrast it with present day conditions and beliefs. In this way we may hope to gain a clearer insight into their mental
life, and to secure a better idea of the values they attach to certain of their activities than is afforded us by actual observation
or by direct inquiry. It is also possible that the tales may give us a glimpse of the early conditions under which this people
developed, of their life and culture before the advent of the European.

</p>
<p id="d0e119">It should be noted at the outset that no attempt is here made to reconstruct an actual historical period. As will appear later,
a part of the material is evidently very old; later introductions&#8212;to which approximate dates may be assigned&#8212;have assumed
places of great importance; while the stories doubtless owe much to the creative imaginations of successive story-tellers.


</p>
<p id="d0e121">A comparison of these tales with the folk-lore of neighboring tribes <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e123"></a>Page 4</span>would be of greatest value, but unfortunately very little material for such a study is available. Under the circumstances
it has seemed best to defer the attempt and to call attention in the footnotes to striking similarities with other fields.


</p>
<p id="d0e125">In the main these tales are so closely associated with the religious beliefs of the present day that it is unlikely they will
be found, in anything approaching their present form, outside the districts dominated by this tribe. Nevertheless, isolated
incidents corresponding to those of neighboring peoples or even of distant lands occur several times.

</p>
<p id="d0e127">Observation has led me to the belief that the religious organization and ceremonies of the Tinguian have reached a higher
development than is found among the neighboring tribes, and that this complexity decreases as we penetrate toward the interior
or to the south. If this be true, it seems evident that the tales based on or associated with them must likewise grow weaker
as we go from Abra.

</p>
<p id="d0e129">I wish here to acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr. Franz Boas and Dr. Berthold Laufer, whose interest and suggestions have
been of greatest value in the preparation of the material for publication; also to express my gratitude to the late Robert
F. Cummings, under whose liberal endowment the field work was carried on. His constant interest made possible the gathering
of the extensive Philippine collections now in the Museum, and it is a matter of deep regret that he did not live to see all
the results of his generosity made available to the reading public.

</p>
<p id="d0e131"><span class="smallcaps">Fay-Cooper Cole</span>,

</p>
<p id="d0e135">Assistant Curator of Malayan Ethnology.

</p>
<p id="d0e137"><span class="smallcaps">Chicago, January</span>, 1915.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e141"></a>Page 5</span></p><a id="d0e144"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p id="d0e147">For the purposes of our study, the tales have been roughly divided into three parts. The first, which deals with the mythical
period, contains thirty-one tales of similar type in which the characters are for the most part the same, although the last
five tales do not properly fit into the cycle, and the concluding story of Indayo is evidently a recent account told in the
form of the older relations.

</p>
<p id="d0e149">In the second division are the ritualistic and explanatory myths, the object of which seems to be to account for the origin
of or way of conducting various ceremonies; for the belief in certain spirits and sacred objects; for the existence of the
sun, moon, and other natural phenomena; for the attainment of fire, food plants, birds and domestic animals, as well as of
magical jars and beads. Here it should be noted that some of the most common and important beliefs and ceremonies are, so
far as is known, unaccompanied by any tales, yet are known to all the population, and are preserved almost without change
from generation to generation.

</p>
<p id="d0e151">Division three contains the ordinary stories with which parents amuse their children or with which men and women while away
the midday hours as they lounge in the field houses, or when they stop on the trail to rest and smoke.

</p>
<p id="d0e153">None of the folk-tales are considered as the property of the tellers, but only those of the third division are well known
to the people in general. Those of the first section are seldom heard except during the dry season when the people gather
around bonfires in various parts of the village. To these go the men and women, the latter to spin cotton, the former to make
fish nets or to repair their tools and weapons. In such a gathering there are generally one or more persons who entertain
their fellows with these tales. Such a person is not paid for his services, but the fact that he knows &#8220;the stories of the
first times&#8221; makes him a welcome addition to the company and gives him an enviable position in the estimation of his fellows.


</p>
<p id="d0e155">The purely ritualistic tales, called <i>d&#299;ams</i>, are learned word by word <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e160"></a>Page 6</span>by the mediums,<a id="d0e162src" href="#d0e162" class="noteref">1</a> as a part of their training for their positions, and are only recited while an animal is being stroked with oil preparatory
to its being sacrificed, or when some other gift is about to be presented to the superior beings. The writer has recorded
these <i>d&#299;ams</i> from various mediums in widely separated towns and has found them quite uniform in text and content. The explanatory tales
were likewise secured from the mediums, or from old men and women who &#8220;know the customs.&#8221; The stories of the last division
are the most frequently heard and, as already indicated, are told by all. It is evident even to the casual reader that these
show much more evidence of outside influence than do the others; some, indeed, appear to have been recently borrowed from
the neighboring christianized Ilocano.<a id="d0e168src" href="#d0e168" class="noteref">2</a>

</p><a id="d0e171"></a><h2>Tales of the Mythical Period</h2>
<p id="d0e174"><span class="smallcaps">Reconstruction of the Culture</span>.&#8212;In the first division certain actors occur with great frequency, while others always take the leading parts. These latter
appear under a variety of names, two or more titles often being used for the same individual in a single tale. To avoid confusion
a list of the fourteen principal actors and their relationships are given in the accompanying table. It will appear that there
are some conflicts in the use of names, but when it is realized that the first twenty-six myths which make up the cycle proper
were secured from six story tellers coming from four different towns, the agreement rather than the disagreement is surprising.
As a matter of fact there is quite as much variation between the accounts of the same narrator as between those gathered from
different towns.

</p>
<p id="d0e239">In consequence of modern rationalism there is a tendency on the part of a considerable number of the Tinguian to consider
these tales purely as stories and the characters as fictitious, but the mass of the people hold them to be true and speak
of the actors as &#8220;the people who lived in the first times.&#8221; For the present we shall take their point of view and shall try
to reconstruct the life in &#8220;the first times&#8221; as it appears in the tales.

</p>
<p id="d0e241">The principal actors live in Kadalayapan and Kaodanan,<a id="d0e243src" href="#d0e243" class="noteref">6</a> towns which our chief story teller&#8212;when trying to explain the desire of Kanag to go down and get fruit&#8212;assures us were somewhere
in the air, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e246"></a>Page 8</span>above the earth (<a id="d0e248" href="#d0e5409">p. 141</a>).<a id="d0e251src" href="#d0e251" class="noteref">7</a> At other times these places are referred to as Sud&#299;pan&#8212;the term by which spirits are supposed to call the present earth&#8212;while
the actors are referred to as &#298;pogau&#8212;the spirit name for Tinguian. Whatever its location it was a place much like the present
home of this people. The sky, the chief abode of spirits and celestial bodies, was above the land, and the heroes of the tales
are pictured as ascending to visit the upper realms. The trees, plants, and animals were for the most part those known to-day.
The ocean appears to have been well known, while mention is made of some places in Luzon, such as Dagopan and San Fernando
in Pangasinan with which the people of to-day are not at all familiar (<a id="d0e254" href="#d0e3747">p. 89</a>, <a id="d0e257" href="#d0e6399">168</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e260">We learn that each village is situated near to a river or waterway by the banks of which shallow wells are dug, and there
we find the women gathering under the shade of the trees, dipping up water to be carried to their homes, washing and combing
their hair, and taking their baths (<a id="d0e262" href="#d0e2394">p. 48</a>). They seldom go singly, for enemies are apt to be near, and unless several are in the company it will be impossible to spread
the alarm and secure help in case of attack (<a id="d0e265" href="#d0e2238">p. 43</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e268">Leading up from the spring to the village are bamboo poles on which the heads of enemies are displayed (<a id="d0e270" href="#d0e2238">p. 43</a>). In cases where the warriors have been especially successful these trophies may surround the whole settlement (<a id="d0e273" href="#d0e3379">p. 76</a>). About the town is a defensive wall, generally of bamboo, but in some cases made up entirely of gigantic snakes (<a id="d0e276" href="#d0e2238">p. 43</a>). Within this inclosure are many houses. The bamboo floors are raised high above the ground, while the thatching is of grass.
Ladders lead up to little porches, from which doors open into the dwellings. At least part of the houses have a cooking room
in addition to that used by the family, while structures containing a ninth room are several times mentioned (pp. <a id="d0e279" href="#d0e2238">43</a>, <a id="d0e282" href="#d0e2519">52</a>, <a id="d0e285" href="#d0e3659">85</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e288">In one corner of the living room is a box containing blankets, above which are pillows and mats used by members of the household
and guests; an iron caldron lies on the floor, while numerous Chinese jars stand about. A hearth, made up of a bed of ashes
in which stones are sunk, is used for cooking. Above it is a bamboo food hanger, while near by stand jars of water and various
cooking pots. Food baskets, coconut shell cups, and dishes, and a quantity of Chinese plates appear when the meal is served,
while the use of glass is not unknown. Cups of gold, wonderful jars, and plates appear at times, but seem to be so rare as
to excite comment (pp. <a id="d0e290" href="#d0e1845">33</a>, <a id="d0e293" href="#d0e4037">98</a>, <a id="d0e296" href="#d0e4159">102</a>, <a id="d0e299" href="#d0e4223">105</a>).
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e302"></a>Page 9</span></p>
<p id="d0e303">Scattered through the village are numerous small buildings known as <i>balaua</i> (<a id="d0e308" href="#d0e2238">p. 43</a>), which are erected for the spirits during the greatest of the ceremonies, and still inside the enclosure are the rice drying
plots and granaries, the latter raised high above the ground so as to protect their contents from moisture (p. <a id="d0e314" href="#d0e5711">150</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e317">About the town pigs and chickens roam at will, while half-starved hunting dogs prowl about below the kitchens and fight for
morsels which drop from above (<a id="d0e319" href="#d0e4086">p. 99</a>). Carabao are kept and used as food (<a id="d0e322" href="#d0e4135">p. 101</a>), but in the cycle proper no mention is made of using them as work animals.<a id="d0e325src" href="#d0e325" class="noteref">8</a> Game, especially deer and wild chickens, and fish are added to the domestic supply of food (<a id="d0e334" href="#d0e3515">p. 80</a>), but the staple appears to be mountain rice. Beans, coconuts, oranges, sugar cane, betel-nuts, and tobacco are also cultivated
(pp. <a id="d0e337" href="#d0e1845">33</a>, <a id="d0e340" href="#d0e4378">107</a>, <a id="d0e343" href="#d0e4715">121</a>, <a id="d0e346" href="#d0e5322">138</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e349">Clothing is scanty but nevertheless receives much attention. The poorest of the men wear clouts of banana leaf, and the women,
when in danger of capture, don skirts of bark; but on most occasions we find the man wearing a colored cotton clout, above
which is a bright belt of the same material, while for ceremonies he may add a short coat or jacket. A headband, sometimes
of gold, keeps his long hair in place, and for very special events he may adorn each hair with a golden bead (pp. <a id="d0e351" href="#d0e3278">74</a>, <a id="d0e354" href="#d0e3379">76</a>, <a id="d0e357" href="#d0e3557">81</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e360">The cotton skirts of the women reach from the waist to the knees; the arms are covered with strands above strands of beads,
while strings of agate beads surround the neck or help to hold the hair in place. To the real hair is often added a switch
which appears to be valued highly (<a id="d0e362" href="#d0e3747">p. 89</a>). Ornaments of gold adorn the ears, and finger rings of the same metal are several times mentioned (pp. <a id="d0e365" href="#d0e2036">39</a>, <a id="d0e368" href="#d0e2238">43</a>, <a id="d0e371" href="#d0e4864">124</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e374">The tales afford us a glimpse of the daily life. In the early morning the chilly mountain air drives the people from their
mats to the yard, where they squat about the fires (<a id="d0e376" href="#d0e5189">p. 132</a>). As it becomes light, part of the women begin pounding out the rice from its straw and husks (<a id="d0e379" href="#d0e5460">p. 144</a>), while others depart for the springs to secure water (<a id="d0e382" href="#d0e4135">p. 101</a>). In planting time husband and wife trudge together to the fields, where the man plants the seeds or cuttings, and his wife
assists by pouring on water (<a id="d0e385" href="#d0e4378">p. 107</a>). In midday, unless it is the busy season, the village activities are practically suspended, and we see the <i>balaua</i> filled with men, asleep or lounging, while children may be playing about with tops or disk-like <i>lipi</i> seeds (<a id="d0e394" href="#d0e5351">p. 139</a>). As it becomes cooler, the town again takes on life; in the houses the women weave blankets or prepare food, the older women
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e397"></a>Page 10</span>feed the chickens and pigs (<a id="d0e399" href="#d0e3894">p. 93</a>), while the workers from the fields, or hunters with their dogs and game, add to the general din and excitement (<a id="d0e402" href="#d0e3515">p. 80</a>). When night comes on, if it be in the dry season, bonfires spring up in different parts of the village, and about them the
girls and women gather to spin. Here also come the men and boys, to lounge and talk (<a id="d0e405" href="#d0e4664">p. 117</a>). A considerable portion of the man's time is taken up in preparation for or actual participation in warfare (<a id="d0e408" href="#d0e3278">p. 74</a>). We have already seen that the constant danger of enemies makes it advisable for the women to go in parties, even to the
village spring. One tale informs us of a girl who is left alone to guard the rice field and is promptly killed by the <i>alzado;</i><a id="d0e413src" href="#d0e413" class="noteref">9</a> another states that &#8220;all the tattooed Igorot are enemies&#8221; (pp. <a id="d0e416" href="#d0e2238">43</a>, <a id="d0e419" href="#d0e5893">155</a>, <a id="d0e422" href="#d0e6136">161</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e425">Revenge for the loss of relations or townspeople is a potent cause of hostile raids; old feuds may be revived by taunts; but
the chief incentive appears to be the desire for renown, to be known as &#8220;a man who goes to fight in the enemies' towns&#8221; (pp.
<a id="d0e427" href="#d0e3792">90</a>, <a id="d0e430" href="#d0e2763">59</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e433">Warriors sometimes go in parties, sometimes alone, but generally in couples (<a id="d0e435" href="#d0e3018">p. 67</a>). At times they lie in ambush and kill young girls who go for water, or old men and women who pass their hiding place (<a id="d0e438" href="#d0e4001">p. 97</a>). Again they go out boldly, armed with shield, spear, and headaxe; they strike their shields as they go and announce their
presence to the enemy (<a id="d0e441" href="#d0e4176">p. 103</a>). In five of the tales the heroes challenge their opponents and then refuse to be the first to use their weapons. It is only
when their foes have tried in vain to injure them that they enter the conflict. In such cases whole towns are wiped out of
existence and a great number of heads and a quantity of jars and other booty is sent back to the towns of the victors (<a id="d0e444" href="#d0e4195">p. 104</a>). Peace is restored in one instance by the payment of a number of valuable jars (<a id="d0e447" href="#d0e3826">p. 91</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e450">Upon the return of a successful war party, the relatives meet them at the gate of the town and compel them to climb the <i>sangap;</i><a id="d0e454src" href="#d0e454" class="noteref">10</a> then invitations are sent out to friends and relatives in neighboring towns to come and aid in the celebration of the victory
(<a id="d0e457" href="#d0e5372">p. 140</a>). When they arrive at the entrance of the village they are met by the townspeople, who offer them liquor and then conduct
them to the houses where they feast and dance to the music of <i>gansas</i> (<a id="d0e463" href="#d0e4947">p. 126</a>).<a id="d0e466src" href="#d0e466" class="noteref">11</a> Finally the captured heads are stuck on the <i>sagang</i><a id="d0e471src" href="#d0e471" class="noteref">12</a> and are placed by the gate, the spring, and, if sufficient <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e474"></a>Page 11</span>in number, surround the town (<a id="d0e476" href="#d0e5372">p. 140</a>). Taking the heads of one's neighbors does not appear to be common, yet cases are mentioned where visitors are treacherously
killed at a dance (pp. <a id="d0e479" href="#d0e3439">78</a>, <a id="d0e482" href="#d0e3599">83</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e485">The use of poison<a id="d0e487src" href="#d0e487" class="noteref">13</a> is twice mentioned. In one case the victims are killed by drinking liquor furnished by the father of the girl about whose
head they are dancing (pp. <a id="d0e490" href="#d0e5601">148</a>, <a id="d0e493" href="#d0e5928">156</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e496">Bamboo spears appear to be used, but we are explicitly told that they fought with steel weapons, and there are frequent references
to headaxes, spears, and knives (pp. <a id="d0e498" href="#d0e2990">65</a>, <a id="d0e501" href="#d0e3379">76</a>, <a id="d0e504" href="#d0e4695">120</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e507">Marriage appears generally to be negotiated by the mother of the youth at his suggestion (<a id="d0e509" href="#d0e5020">p. 128</a>). At times both his parents go to the girl's home, and after many preliminaries broach the subject of their mission (<a id="d0e512" href="#d0e5020">p. 128</a>). The girl's people discuss the proposition, and if they are favorable they set a day for the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>&#8212;a celebration at which the price to be paid for the bride is decided upon (<a id="d0e518" href="#d0e2417">p. 49</a>). The parents of the groom then return home after having left some small present, such as a jar or an agate bead, as a sign
of engagement (<a id="d0e521" href="#d0e5020">p. 128</a>)<a id="d0e524src" href="#d0e524" class="noteref">14</a>. The <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> is held a few days later at the girl's home, and for this event her people prepare a quantity of food (<a id="d0e536" href="#d0e3179">p. 72</a>). On the agreed day the close friends and relatives of both families will assemble. Those who accompany the groom carry jars
and pigs, either in part payment for the bride, or to serve as food for the company (pp. <a id="d0e539" href="#d0e3179">72</a>, <a id="d0e542" href="#d0e5020">128</a>). The first hours are spent in bargaining over the price the girl should bring, but when this is settled a feast is prepared,
and then all indulge in dancing the <i>tadek</i> (<a id="d0e548" href="#d0e2763">p. 59</a>)<a id="d0e551src" href="#d0e551" class="noteref">15</a>. When the payment is made a portion is distributed among the girl's relatives (pp. <a id="d0e557" href="#d0e3179">72</a>, <a id="d0e560" href="#d0e3278">74</a>), but her parents retain the greater part for themselves<a id="d0e563src" href="#d0e563" class="noteref">16</a>. The groom cannot yet claim his bride, although in one case he is allowed to take her immediately after the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> by making a special payment for the privilege (<a id="d0e572" href="#d0e3278">p. 74</a>). A few nights later the groom goes to the girl's home carrying with him an empty jar with which he makes the final payment
(<a id="d0e575" href="#d0e3242">p. 73</a>). The customary rice ceremony<a id="d0e578src" href="#d0e578" class="noteref">17</a> follows and he is then entitled to his bride <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e584"></a>Page 12</span>(<a id="d0e586" href="#d0e3242">p. 73</a>). Should the house or anything in it break at this time, it foretells misfortune for the couple, hence precautions are taken
lest such a sign should, by accident, be given (<a id="d0e589" href="#d0e2816">p. 60</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e592">In all but two cases mentioned the girl and her husband go to live with his people. In the first instance their failure to
do so raises a protest; in the second, the girl's parents are of much more importance than those of the groom, and this may
explain their ability to retain their daughter (pp. <a id="d0e594" href="#d0e5322">138</a>, <a id="d0e597" href="#d0e6050">159</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e600">When the bride reaches her future home, she sits on the bamboo floor with her legs stretched out in front of her. The slats
which she covers are counted and a string of agate beads, equal in length to the combined width of the slats, is given to
her. She now becomes a full member of the family and seems to be under the orders of her mother-in-law (<a id="d0e602" href="#d0e2816">p. 60</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e605">The tales give constant sanction for the marriage of near relatives. Dumanau, we are told, marries his cousin<a id="d0e607src" href="#d0e607" class="noteref">18</a>, while we frequently meet with such statements as, &#8220;We are relatives and it is good for us to be married&#8221;, or &#8220;They saw that
they were related and that both possessed magical power, so they were married (<a id="d0e613" href="#d0e1945">p. 35</a>)&#8221;. It appears that a man may live with his sweetheart and have children by her, yet leave her, and, without reproach, marry
another better fitted to be his wife (<a id="d0e616" href="#d0e2565">p. 54</a>). He may also accept payment for a wife who has deserted him, apparently without loss of prestige (<a id="d0e619" href="#d0e2956">p. 64</a>). No objection seems to be raised to a man having two wives so long as one of these is an inhabitant of the upper world (<a id="d0e622" href="#d0e4500">p. 111</a>), but we find Kanag telling his former sweetheart that he cannot marry her since he is now married to another (<a id="d0e625" href="#d0e5322">p. 138</a>). Again, when two women lay claim to Apon&#299;tolau, as their husband, they undergo a test and the loser returns to her former
home (<a id="d0e628" href="#d0e3922">p. 94</a>). However, this rule does not prevent a man from having several concubines (<a id="d0e631" href="#d0e4695">p. 120</a>). Gaw&#299;gawen, we are told, is accompanied to a <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> by eighteen young girls who are his concubines (<a id="d0e637" href="#d0e2763">p. 59</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e640">Divorce is twice mentioned, but it seems to call out protest only from the cast off wife (pp. <a id="d0e642" href="#d0e2920">63</a>, <a id="d0e645" href="#d0e5638">149</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e648">Closely associated with the celebration of a marriage seems to be a ceremony known as <i>Sayang</i>, during the progress of which a number of small structures&#8212;the largest known as <i>balaua</i>&#8212;are built. Judging by their names and descriptions, we are justified in considering them &#8220;spirit houses&#8221; as they are to-day.


</p>
<p id="d0e656">The details of the extended <i>Sayang</i> ceremony are nowhere given, but so much is made plain:&#8212;At its beginning many people pound rice, for <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e661"></a>Page 13</span>use in the offerings and for food, and <i>da-eng</i><a id="d0e665src" href="#d0e665" class="noteref">19</a> is danced (<a id="d0e668" href="#d0e2062">p. 40</a>). After the <i>L&#299;bon</i><a id="d0e673src" href="#d0e673" class="noteref">20</a> invitations are sent out, by means of betel-nuts covered with gold, to those whose presence is especially desired (<a id="d0e679" href="#d0e2864">p. 62</a>). When the guests arrive at the village spring or gate they are offered food or drink, and then while they dance they are
sprinkled with water or rice, after which all go up to the town (<a id="d0e682" href="#d0e2161">p. 41 note 2</a>). A medium who knows the customs and desires of the spirits constructs a bamboo mat, which is known as <i>talap&#299;tap</i>, and on it offers food. To call their attention she frequently strikes the ground with the <i>dak&#299;dak</i>&#8212;split sticks of bamboo and <i>lono</i><a id="d0e693src" href="#d0e693" class="noteref">21</a> (<a id="d0e696" href="#d0e2062">p. 40</a>). The guests are not neglected, so far as regards food, for feasting and dancing occupy a considerable portion of their time.
The ceremonial dance <i>da-eng</i><a href="#d0e665" class="noteref">19</a> is mentioned, but the <i>tadek</i><a id="d0e705src" href="#d0e705" class="noteref">22</a> seems to be the one in special favor (pp. <a id="d0e711" href="#d0e2147">41</a>, <a id="d0e714" href="#d0e2763">59</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e717">One tale tells us that the <i>Sayang</i> was held immediately following a head hunt; and another, that Apon&#299;tolau went out to get the head of an old man before he
started this ceremony (pp. <a id="d0e722" href="#d0e3051">69</a>, <a id="d0e725" href="#d0e3379">76</a>); however, the evidence is by no means conclusive that it is related to warfare.

</p>
<p id="d0e728">On <a id="d0e730" href="#d0e4223">page 105</a> we are told that Kanag's half sister is a medium, and the description of her method of summoning the spirits tallies with
that of to-day. At the <i>Sayang</i> ceremony she is called to perform the <i>Dawak</i><a id="d0e738src" href="#d0e738" class="noteref">23</a>, with the assistance of the old woman Alokot&aacute;n (<a id="d0e741" href="#d0e4277">p. 106</a>). The <i>Dawak</i> is also held in order to stop the flow of blood from Apon&#299;tolau's finger (<a id="d0e747" href="#d0e4556">p. 113</a>). The only other ceremony mentioned is that made in order to find a lost switch (<a id="d0e750" href="#d0e3826">p. 91</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e753">Certain well-known customs are strongly brought out in our material. The first, and apparently most important, is the necessity
of offering liquor and food, both to strangers and to guests (<a id="d0e755" href="#d0e2712">p. 58</a>). Refusal is so keenly resented that in one instance a couple decline to allow their daughter to marry a man whose emissaries
reject this gift (<a id="d0e758" href="#d0e3242">p. 73</a>). Old quarrels are closed by the tender of food or drink, and friendships are cemented by the drinking of <i>basi</i><a id="d0e763src" href="#d0e763" class="noteref">24</a> (<a id="d0e766" href="#d0e5258">p. 134</a>). People meeting for the first time, and even friends who have been separated for a while, chew betel-nut together and tell
their names and places of residence. We are repeatedly told that it is necessary to chew the nut and make known their <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e769"></a>Page 14</span>names, for &#8220;we cannot tell our names unless we chew,&#8221; and &#8220;it is bad for us if we do not know each other's names when we talk.&#8221;
A certain etiquette is followed at this time: old men precede the younger; people of the home town, the visitors; and men
always are before the women (pp. <a id="d0e771" href="#d0e2307">45</a>, <a id="d0e774" href="#d0e5227">133</a>). The conduct of Awig when he serves liquor to the <i>alzados</i><a id="d0e779src" href="#d0e779" class="noteref">25</a> is that of to-day, i.e., the person who serves always drinks before passing it to others (<a id="d0e785" href="#d0e5928">p. 156</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e788">Certain other rules of etiquette or restrictions on conduct come out in the tales. We learn that it is not considered proper
for a man to eat with the wife of another during his absence, nor should they start the meal before he comes in (<a id="d0e790" href="#d0e2519">p. 52</a>). The master of a dance is deeply chagrined and chides his wife severely, because she insists on dancing before he has invited
all the others to take their turns (<a id="d0e793" href="#d0e3100">p. 70</a>). Greediness is reproved in children and Apon&#299;tolau causes the death of his concubines whose false tales had led him to maltreat
his wife (<a id="d0e796" href="#d0e4637">p. 116</a>). Unfaithfulness seems to be sufficient justification for a man to abandon his wife and kill her admirer (<a id="d0e799" href="#d0e3439">p. 78</a>); but Kanag appears as a hero when he refuses to attack his father who has sought his life (<a id="d0e802" href="#d0e4715">p. 121</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e805">Of the ceremonies connected with death we learn very little except that the women discard their arm beads, the mourners don
old clothing, and all wail for the dead (pp. <a id="d0e807" href="#d0e2276">44</a>, <a id="d0e810" href="#d0e3792">90</a>). Three times we are told that the deceased is placed on a <i>tabalang</i>, or raft, on which a live rooster is fastened before it is set adrift on the river. In the tales the raft and fowl are of
gold, but this is surprising even to the old woman Alokot&aacute;n, past whose home in Nagbotobot&aacute;n all these rafts must go (<a id="d0e816" href="#d0e5113">p. 131</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e819">Up to this time in our reconstruction of the life of &#8220;the first times&#8221; we have mentioned nothing impossible or improbable
to the present day Tinguian, although, as we shall see later, there are some striking differences in customs and ideas. We
have purposely left the description of the people and their practice of magic to the last, although their magical practices
invade every activity of their lives, for it is here that the greatest variations from present conditions apparently occur.


</p>
<p id="d0e821">These people had intimate relations with some of the lesser spirits, especially with the <i>liblibayan</i><a id="d0e825src" href="#d0e825" class="noteref">26</a>, who appear to be little more than their servants, with the evil spirits known as <i>banban&aacute;yo</i><a href="#d0e825" class="noteref">26</a>, and with the <i>alan</i><a href="#d0e825" class="noteref">26</a> (<a id="d0e836" href="#d0e4771">p. 123</a>). The <i>alan</i>, just mentioned, are to-day considered as deformed spirits who live in the forests: &#8220;They are as large as people but have
wings and can fly; their toes are at the back of their feet and their fingers point backwards from their wrists.&#8221; The several
references to them in <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e842"></a>Page 15</span>the tales such as &#8220;you <i>alan</i> girls whose toes on your feet turn out&#8221; indicate they were so considered in the first times (<a id="d0e847" href="#d0e6136">p. 161</a>). Some of them are addressed as &#8220;you <i>alan</i> of the springs,&#8221; and in one instance a man dives down into the water where the <i>alan</i> live (<a id="d0e856" href="#d0e5601">p. 148</a>), but in general their homes seem to be similar to but much finer than those of the people of Kadalayapan and Kaodanan. These
spirits appear time after time as the foster mothers of the leading characters: Generally they secure a drop of menstrual
blood, a miscarriage, or the afterbirth, and all unknown to the real parents, change them into children and raise them (<a id="d0e859" href="#d0e3599">p. 83</a>). These foster children are pictured as living in houses of gold situated near springs, the pebbles of which are of gold
or beads;<a id="d0e862src" href="#d0e862" class="noteref">27</a> the places where the women set the pots while dipping water are big plates or dishes, while similar dishes form the stepping
stones leading up to the house. Articles of gold are found in the dwellings and valuable jars are numerous. When the true
relationships of these children are established they always go to their blood parents, carrying with them these riches, which
are a source of wonder and comment (pp. <a id="d0e871" href="#d0e2238">43</a>, <a id="d0e874" href="#d0e2956">64</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e877">The people of Kadalayapan and Kaodanan have many dealings with the celestial bodies. The big star Bagbagak appears as the
husband of S&#299;nag&#8212;the moon&#8212;and father of the star maiden Gaygay&oacute;ma, who, Apon&#299;tolau assures his wife, is a spirit. When this
girl comes down to steal sugar-cane she takes off her star dress and appears as a beautiful maiden;<a id="d0e879src" href="#d0e879" class="noteref">28</a> she becomes enamored with Apon&#299;tolau and takes him to the sky, where he lives with her. They have a child, who later marries
in Kadalayapan and thereafter stays below. Upon the occasion when Apon&#299;tolau visits his first wife and fails to return to
the sky at the appointed time, a great company of stars are sent to fetch him, with orders to devour him if he refuses to
obey (<a id="d0e885" href="#d0e4463">p. 109</a>, ff.).

</p>
<p id="d0e888">In the first tale Apon&#299;tolau himself appears as &#8220;the sun,&#8221; &#8220;the man who makes the sun,&#8221; as &#8220;a round stone which rolls,&#8221; but
when it is established that he is the son of a couple in Kadalayapan he apparently relinquishes his duties in the sky and
goes to live in the village of his people. With him goes his wife Apon&#299;bolinayen, who had been carried above by a vine. While
at his post in the heavens, Apon&#299;tolau is closely associated with the big star, whose duty it is to follow him in the sky.
Again we are told that Apon&#299;tolau is taken up by the spirit Kabkabaga-an, whom he marries and by whom he has a son (<a id="d0e890" href="#d0e4574">p. 114</a>). In some instances <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e893"></a>Page 16</span>this hero and his son Kanag converse with thunder and lightning, which appear at times not unlike human beings (<a id="d0e895" href="#d0e4099">p. 100</a>); but in the eighth relation the two kinds of lightning are pictured as dogs who guard the town of Dona.

</p>
<p id="d0e898">These people enjoy unusual relations with inanimate things, and we find them conversing with spears and with jars.<a id="d0e900src" href="#d0e900" class="noteref">29</a> In one case the latter appear to be pastured like animals, and surround Apon&#299;tolau when he goes to feed them with <i>lawed</i><a id="d0e920src" href="#d0e920" class="noteref">30</a> leaves and salt (<a id="d0e925" href="#d0e2483">p. 51</a>). Weapons weep blood and oil when taken down for the purpose of injuring certain persons (<a id="d0e928" href="#d0e2238">p. 43</a>). A nose flute, when played by a youth, tells him of his mother's plight (<a id="d0e931" href="#d0e5833">p. 152</a>), while a bamboo Jew's harp summons the brothers of its owner (<a id="d0e934" href="#d0e6173">p. 162</a>). Animals and birds are frequently in communication with them: The hawk flies away and spreads the news of the fight at Adasin<a id="d0e937src" href="#d0e937" class="noteref">31</a> (<a id="d0e946" href="#d0e3792">p. 90</a>); at the bidding of Dalon&aacute;gan a spider spins a web about the town (<a id="d0e949" href="#d0e4864">p. 124</a>); and Apon&#299;tolau is enabled to fulfill the labors assigned him by the ten-headed giant only through the aid of spiders, ants,
and flies (<a id="d0e952" href="#d0e4135">p. 101</a>).<a id="d0e955src" href="#d0e955" class="noteref">32</a> During certain dances the water from the river flows over the town and fish come up and bite the feet of the dancers (<a id="d0e967" href="#d0e2763">p. 59</a>). Crocodiles are left to guard the sister of Apon&#299;balagen, and when they fail to explain their negligence they are whipped
and sent away by their master (<a id="d0e970" href="#d0e3682">p. 87</a>). A great bird is pleased with Apon&#299;tolau and carries him away<a id="d0e973src" href="#d0e973" class="noteref">33</a> to its home, where it forces him to marry a woman it had previously captured (<a id="d0e979" href="#d0e3876">p. 92</a>). In one instance an animal gives birth to a human child; a frog laps up the spittle of Apon&#299;tolau, and as a result becomes
pregnant<a id="d0e982src" href="#d0e982" class="noteref">34</a> and gives birth to a maiden who is taken away by the spirits (<a id="d0e997" href="#d0e4223">p. 105</a>). Another account states that the three sons of Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen are born as pigs, but later assume human form
(<a id="d0e1000" href="#d0e4637">p. 116</a>). Kanag becomes a snake when he tries to secure the perfume of Baliw&aacute;n, but is restored to human form when he <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1003"></a>Page 17</span>bathes in a magic well (<a id="d0e1005" href="#d0e5296">p. 137</a>). These and other mysterious happenings, many of which are not explained as being due to their own volition, befall them;
thus Ingiwan, while walking, is confronted by an impassable hill and is compelled to cross the ocean, where he finds his future
wife, but upon his return the hill has vanished (<a id="d0e1008" href="#d0e3671">p. 86</a>). In other instances the finger rings of people meeting for the first time exchange themselves (<a id="d0e1011" href="#d0e3876">p. 92</a>). The headband of L&#299;g&#299; flies away without his knowledge and alights on the skirt of a girl who is bathing in the river. As
a result she becomes pregnant, and when the facts become known L&#299;g&#299; is recognized as the child's father (<a id="d0e1014" href="#d0e5460">p. 144</a>). It seems probable that the superior powers are responsible for these occurrences, for in at least one instance the great
spirit Kabon&#299;yan steals a maiden and turns her into a flock of birds, who talk with and assist the owner of a rice field (<a id="d0e1017" href="#d0e5787">p. 151</a>).

<p id="d0e1020">While they thus appear to be to a certain extent under the control of the spirits and to be surrounded by animals and inanimate
things with human intelligence and speech, the people of these &#8220;first times&#8221; possess great power over nature: Time and space
are annihilated, for at their will daylight comes at once (<a id="d0e1022" href="#d0e5711">p. 150</a>), or they are transported to a place in an instant (<a id="d0e1025" href="#d0e3876">p. 92</a>). At their command people appear: Kanag creates betel-nut trees, then cuts the fruit into bits, which he sows on the ground.
From these come many people who are his neighbors, and one of whom he marries (<a id="d0e1028" href="#d0e4715">p. 121</a>). The course of nature is changed: A field is planted in an instant; the crops mature in a few days, and the grain and fruits
take themselves to the store-house (<a id="d0e1031" href="#d0e5711">p. 150</a>).

A storm is called upon to carry a person or a building to a distance (<a id="d0e1058" href="#d0e4715">p. 121</a>), and a spring is created by killing an old man (<a id="d0e1061" href="#d0e2816">p. 60</a>).<a id="d0e1064src" href="#d0e1064" class="noteref">36</a> Prepared food appears at a word; a stick when cooked becomes a fish, and though it is repeatedly broken and served it always

At a word of command the spears and headaxes of the people of Kadalayapan and Kaodanan go out and kill great numbers of

Many methods of restoring the dead to life are employed; spittle is applied to the wounds, or the victim is placed in a
magic well, but the common method is for the hero &#8220;to whip his perfume,&#8221;<a id="d0e1129src" href="#d0e1129" class="noteref">38</a> whereupon the dead follow his commands (pp. <a id="d0e1138" href="#d0e5833">152</a>, <a id="d0e1141" href="#d0e5982">157</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e1144">The birth of a child, to a woman of these times, is generally preceded by an intense itching between the third and last fingers,
and when this spot is pricked the child pops out &#8220;like popped rice.&#8221;<a id="d0e1146src" href="#d0e1146" class="noteref">39</a> Its growth is always magical, for at each bath its stature increases by a span (<a id="d0e1158" href="#d0e4159">p. 102</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e1167">The power of assuming animal forms appears to be a common possession, and we find the different characters changing themselves
into fire-flies, ants, centipedes, omen birds, and in one case into oil<a id="d0e1169src" href="#d0e1169" class="noteref">40</a> (pp. <a id="d0e1184" href="#d0e3659">85</a>, <a id="d0e1187" href="#d0e4086">99</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e1190">One of the most peculiar yet constantly used powers of these people is their ability to send betel-nuts on various missions.
Whenever an invitation to a ceremony or celebration is to be extended, nuts covered <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1192"></a>Page 19</span>with gold are oiled and sent out. They go to the intended guest, state their errand, and, if refused, forthwith proceed to
grow on his knee, forehead, or pet pig, until pain or pity compels him to accept (<a id="d0e1194" href="#d0e5544">p. 146</a>). In some cases it appears that the nuts themselves possess the magic properties, for we find Apon&#299;tolau demanding that his
conquered foes give him their betel-nuts with magic power (<a id="d0e1197" href="#d0e3826">p. 91</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e1200">Relationships can be readily ascertained by the chewing of these nuts, for when the quids are laid down they are transformed
into agate and golden beads and lie in such a manner that the associations are fully established (pp. <a id="d0e1202" href="#d0e1945">35</a>, <a id="d0e1205" href="#d0e1968">36</a>, <a id="d0e1208" href="#d0e2147">41</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e1211">Enough has been mentioned to show how important a part magic and magical practices play in the life of this people, but one
further reference should be made, since it is found in nearly every tale. When the marriage price is settled upon, the mother
of the groom exercises her power and at once fills the spirit house with valuable jars and the like; this is repeated until
enough are gathered to meet the demands of the girl's people (<a id="d0e1213" href="#d0e5227">p. 133</a>). Even when the agreed sum has been delivered we often find the girl's mother herself practicing magic, to secure additional
payment, and by raising her elbows or eyebrows causing a part of the jars to vanish (pp. <a id="d0e1216" href="#d0e5227">133</a>, <a id="d0e1219" href="#d0e5437">143</a>).

</p>
<p id="d0e1222">Despite their great gifts we find that these people are not all-powerful and that they deem it wise to consult the omens before
starting on a task or a journey. The gall sack and liver of a pig are eagerly examined,<a id="d0e1224src" href="#d0e1224" class="noteref">41</a> while the calls of birds, actions of animals, or signs received from the thunder and lightning regulate their conduct. In
cases where these warnings are disregarded misfortune or death always overtakes the individual (pp. <a id="d0e1233" href="#d0e2394">48</a>, <a id="d0e1236" href="#d0e2417">49</a>, <a id="d0e1239" href="#d0e4099">100</a> ff).

<p id="d0e1242">Death comes to them, but apparently is only a temporary state. The deceased are often revived by some magical process (<a id="d0e1244" href="#d0e5833">p. 152</a>), but if not the corpse is placed on a raft and is set adrift on the river.<a id="d0e1247src" href="#d0e1247" class="noteref">42</a> The streams and rivers, we are told, all flow past Nagbotobot&aacute;n before they empty into the hole where all streams go. In
this place lives the old woman Alokot&aacute;n, who is related to the people of Kadalayapan and Kaodanan. Her duty it is to watch
for dead relatives, to secure them, and make them alive again (<a id="d0e1253" href="#d0e5189">p. 132</a>). She is the owner of a magic pool, the waters of which revive the dead and renew youth.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1256"></a>Page 20</span></p>
<p id="d0e1257"><span class="smallcaps">Comparison of the Reconstructed Culture with Present Day Conditions</span>.&#8212;Before passing to a consideration of the tales in the last two divisions of our material, it may be well to compare the
life and beliefs of these &#8220;people of the first times&#8221; with those of the living Tinguian. Kadalayapan and Kaodanan appear,
in a vague way, to have been located in Abra, for we learn that the Ilocano, Don Carlos, went up the river from Baygan (Vigan)<a id="d0e1261src" href="#d0e1261" class="noteref">43</a> to Kadalayapan; that the <i>alzados</i><a id="d0e1266src" href="#d0e1266" class="noteref">44</a> lived near by; while the tattooed Igorot occupied the land to the south (pp. <a id="d0e1272" href="#d0e3418">77</a>, <a id="d0e1275" href="#d0e5893">155</a>). The villages were surrounded by defensive walls such as were to be found about all Tinguian villages until recent times,
and which are still to be seen about Abang and other settlements. Within the walls were many houses, the descriptions of most
of which would fit the dwellings of to day. The one thing which seems foreign to present conditions is the so-called &#8220;ninth
room&#8221; which receives rather frequent mention. There is nothing in the tales referring to buildings or house construction which
lends support to the contention of those who seek to class the Tinguian as a modified sub-group of Igorot.<a id="d0e1278src" href="#d0e1278" class="noteref">45</a> The Bontoc type of dwelling with its ground floor sleeping box and its elevated one room kitchen and storage room is nowhere
mentioned, neither is there any indication that in past or present times the Tinguian had separate sleeping houses for the
unmarried men and boys, and for the girls, as do their neighbors to the south.

</p>
<p id="d0e1283">The other structures, such as the spirit houses, rice drying frames, and granaries were similar to those seen to-day in all
the villages. Likewise the house furnishings, the musical instruments, and even the games of the children were such as are
to be found at present, while our picture of the village life given on page 9 still fits nearly any Tinguian settlement in
Abra. The animals mentioned are all familiar to the present people, but it is worthy of note that in the first twenty-six
tales, which make up the cycle proper, the horse is not mentioned, nor does the carabao appear to be used as a work animal.
Still more important is the fact that the terraced fields and the rice culture accompanying them, which to-day occupy a predominant
place in the economic life of the people, are nowhere mentioned. On the other hand, the <i>langp&aacute;dan</i>, or mountain rice, assumes a place of great importance. References to the cultivation of the land all seem to indicate that
the &#8220;hoe culture,&#8221; which is still practiced to a limited extent, took the place of agriculture.

</p>
<p id="d0e1288">The clothing, hair dressing, and ornaments, worn by these people, agree closely with those of to-day. Beads seems to have
been of prime <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1290"></a>Page 21</span>importance, but could scarcely have been more prized or more used than at present. Unless she be in mourning, the hair and
neck of each woman are now ornamented with strings of beads, many of them of evident antiquity, while strands above strands
cover the arms from the wrist to the elbow or even reach to the shoulder.<a id="d0e1292src" href="#d0e1292" class="noteref">46</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e1306">The wealth of a person seems to have been, to a large extent, determined by the number of old jars in his possession. As at
the present time, they formed the basis of settlement for feuds, as payment for a bride, and even figured in the marriage
ceremony itself. The jars, as judged from their names, were evidently of ancient Chinese manufacture, and possessed power
of speech and motion similar to that of human beings; but in a lesser measure the same type of jars have similar powers to-day.<a id="d0e1308src" href="#d0e1308" class="noteref">47</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e1320">The use of gold and jewels seems to have been common in the old times; the latter are seldom seen in the district to-day,
but the use of bits of gold in the various ceremonies is still common, while earrings of gold or copper are among the most
prized possessions of the women.<a id="d0e1322src" href="#d0e1322" class="noteref">48</a> Placer mining is well known to the Igorot of the south, who melt and cast the metal into various ornaments. So far as I am
aware, this is not practiced by the present Tinguian, but may point back to a time when the industry was known in this region,
or when trade relations with the south were much freer than in recent years.

</p>
<p id="d0e1325">The weapons of the warriors, which we are specifically told were of metal, are identical with those seen at the present time,
while the methods of warfare agree with the accounts still told by the old men of their youthful exploits.

</p>
<p id="d0e1327">A survey of the tales brings out boldly the fact that a headhunt was one of the most important events in Tinguian life. To-day
stress of circumstances has caused the custom to suffer a rapid decline, but even now heads are occasionally taken, while
most of the old men have vivid recollections of the days when they fought &#8220;in the towns of their enemies.&#8221; A spirited account
of a head celebration seen in the village of Lagangilang&#8212;from which ten of these tales were collected&#8212;will be <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1329"></a>Page 22</span>found in the writings of La Gironi&egrave;re, already referred to.<a id="d0e1334src" href="#d0e1334" class="noteref">49</a> It is important to note that this account, as well as those secured from many warriors of the present generation, offers
some striking differences to the procedure in the olden days, particularly as regards the disposal of the skulls. The tales
tell of the heads being placed on the <i>sagang</i><a id="d0e1342src" href="#d0e1342" class="noteref">50</a> at the spring, at the gate, or about the town, after the celebration. Certain of the present villages make use of the <i>sagang</i>, but the more common type of head holder is the <i>saloko</i>,<a id="d0e1354src" href="#d0e1354" class="noteref">51</a> which still figures in many ceremonies. However, the heads only remain in these receptacles until the day set for the festival.
They are then carried to the centre of the village and there, amid great rejoicing, are cut open; the brains are removed and
to them are added the lobes of the ears and joints of the little fingers, and the whole is then placed in the liquor, which
is served to the dancers. Before the guests depart the skulls are broken into small pieces and a fragment is presented to
each male guest, who carries it home and is thus often reminded of the valor of the takers.<a id="d0e1357src" href="#d0e1357" class="noteref">52</a> A study of Tinguian beliefs furnishes an additional religious motive for the taking of heads, but with the people of Kadalayapan
and Kaodanan revenge and the desire for renown were the prime incentives.

</p>
<p id="d0e1366">Every tale emphasizes the importance of the <i>Sayang</i> ceremony and the spirit structure known as <i>balaua</i>.<a id="d0e1374src" href="#d0e1374" class="noteref">53</a> The ceremony is nowhere described in full, but the many details which are supplied show that it was almost identical with
that of to-day. The same is true of the <i>Dawak</i>,<a id="d0e1383src" href="#d0e1383" class="noteref">54</a> which we find mentioned on three different occasions, and of the ceremony made to aid in locating lost or stolen articles.
The most noticeable fact, to the person familiar with Tinguian life, is that these are the only ceremonies mentioned among
the many known and practiced at present. More than a score of different rites are now well known to this people, and occupy
a very considerable portion of their time and attention during the first four months of the year.

</p>
<p id="d0e1389">The failure to make mention of these very important events is explained, it seems to me, not by their absence, but by the
fact that these rites vary in importance and that the privilege of celebrating them is hereditary in a family. Should one
not entitled to hold such a ceremony <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1391"></a>Page 23</span>desire to do so, he must first give, in order, all the lesser events, a costly procedure extending over a period of several
years. The people of Kadalayapan and Kaodanan always appear as being closely related to the spirit Kabon&#299;yan,<a id="d0e1393src" href="#d0e1393" class="noteref">55</a> and exceedingly powerful. It seems probable that the story teller takes it for granted that all of them are entitled to hold
the most important ceremony known to the Tinguian.

</p>
<p id="d0e1402">A prominent figure in these rites is the medium, through whom the ancient people generally conversed with the spirits, but
in exceptional cases we found the heroes talking direct with the superior beings; however, this gift is not confined to the
men of old, for in such tales as 55 and 59 people who are believed to have lived recently have conversed with the spirits
and have even been joined to them in marriage.

</p>
<p id="d0e1404">The procedure in choosing a bride, the engagement, the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>,<a id="d0e1409src" href="#d0e1409" class="noteref">56</a> and the marriage proper are all those of the present day, but the rules governing the marriage of relatives differ radically.
As already noted, one of the chief qualifications for marriage, among the people of the tales, was relationship, and even
cousins became husband and wife. Such a thing is unthinkable among the Tinguian of to-day; first cousins are absolutely barred
from marrying, while even the union of second cousins would cause a scandal, and it is very doubtful if such a wife would
be allowed to share in her deceased husband's property.<a id="d0e1415src" href="#d0e1415" class="noteref">57</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e1424">It appears that only one real<a id="d0e1426src" href="#d0e1426" class="noteref">58</a> wife is recognized as legitimate, but that from &#8220;the first times&#8221; to the present a man might have as many concubines as he
could secure.

</p>
<p id="d0e1429">So far as mythology and present day conditions can inform us the bride has always gone to the home of her husband and, for
a time at least, has been subject to the dictations of her mother-in-law, although the couple are generally soon established
in a home of their own, in the town of the groom. There is nothing in Tinguian life or tradition to indicate that they have
ever had a clan system or a matriarchal form of government.

</p>
<p id="d0e1431">The few references to the procedure immediately after a death indicate that, in part, the people of to-day follow the old
custom; but here again an important departure occurs. We are thrice told that the corpse was placed on a little raft called
<i>tabalang</i> and set adrift on the river; and <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1436"></a>Page 24</span>in one case the afterbirth was treated in the same manner. Nothing of the sort is done to-day, nor does it seem at all likely
that such has been the case in recent generations. The body is now buried beneath the house, and certain set rules govern
the movements of all persons related to the deceased, as well as the disposal of the corpse. This procedure is so complex
and so uniform throughout the whole Tinguian belt that it seems improbable that it has grown up, except through a long period
of time. At this point it is interesting to note that at many ceremonies it is necessary to construct a small raft called
<i>tal-talababong,</i> or <i>talabong</i>, to place offerings in it, and set it adrift on the stream, in order that any spirits who have been prevented from attending
the ceremony may still secure their share.<a id="d0e1444src" href="#d0e1444" class="noteref">59</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e1468">The festivals, the dances, the observances of the proprieties required by good breeding or custom of to-day, follow closely
those given in the tales. The greatest divergence is in the offering of betel-nuts and the telling of names, which occupies
such an important place in the narratives. The use of betel-nut for chewing is less common among the Tinguian people than
with most other Philippine tribes, a fact which may be accounted for by their constant use of tobacco. However, betel-nuts
still occupy a most important place in the various ceremonies, and many offerings intended for the spirits must be accompanied
with the prepared nut. In nearly every instance when invitations were sent out, for a ceremony, the people of the tales intrusted
an oiled betel-nut covered with gold with this duty. This has its counterpart to-day in the small gifts of gold which are
often carried to some friend, in another town, whose presence is particularly desired. It seems not improbable that the golden
colored husks of the ripe betel-nuts may have suggested the substitution.

</p>
<p id="d0e1470">Magic was practiced extensively in &#8220;the first time,&#8221; but it is by no means unknown to the people of the present day. They
cannot now bring a dead person to life, or create human beings out of bits of betel-nut; <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1472"></a>Page 25</span>but they can and do cause sickness and death to their foes by performing certain rites or directing actions against garments
or other objects recently in their possession. Even the name of an enemy can be applied to an animal or inanimate object and
action against it be transferred to the owner.

</p>
<p id="d0e1474">Like the Tinguian, the people of Kadalayapan and Kaodanan are warned or encouraged by omens received through the medium of
birds, thunder, lightning, or the condition of the gall and liver of a slaughtered pig;<a id="d0e1476src" href="#d0e1476" class="noteref">60</a> and like them they suffer for failure to heed these warnings, or for the infraction of a taboo.

</p>
<p id="d0e1485">The myths of the first division make it plain that, to the people of those times, the sun, moon, and stars were animate&#8212;either
spirits or human beings. In some cases a similar conception was held for thunder and lightning, while in others they appear
as animals. It will appear that such ideas are not foreign to the second division of the tales, which represent present day
beliefs. Thus, in the mountain village of Baay the sky is considered as a male spirit&#8212;the husband of the earth, and father
of sun and moon. Again, in Lagangilang and Abang, the thunderbolt is identified as Kadaklan&#8212;the most powerful of all spirits&#8212;who
&#8220;often eats the ground and releases his wife Ag&#7431;m&#7431;m.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e1487">This brings us to a most interesting question, namely: Are the chief actors in our tales to be considered as celestial beings
and spirits, or as human heroes? We have already made note of the fact that in the first tale Apon&#299;tolau is identified with
Ini-init whom, we are told, was &#8220;the sun,&#8221; &#8220;the man who makes the sun,&#8221; &#8220;a round stone which rolls.&#8221; In this tale he marries
Apon&#299;bolinayen, a maiden whose name may possibly be construed to mean &#8220;the woman in the moon.&#8221;<a id="d0e1489src" href="#d0e1489" class="noteref">61</a> However, we find Apon&#299;tolau abandoning his place in the sky and going to reside in Kadalayapan. This tale comes from the
town of Langangilang where, as we have already seen, the celestial beings are regarded as spirits. Tale fifteen, coming from
the same town, shows us this same Apon&#299;tolau going up to the sky, where he marries the spirit Kabkabaga-an, but as before
he returns to his home below. A further indication of his celestial character is perhaps afforded us in tale fourteen, which
was recorded in Patok, a valley town in which the sun, moon, and stars are now regarded as &#8220;lights&#8221; belonging to the spirit
Kadaklan. Here we find that Apon&#299;tolau marries the star maid Gaygay&oacute;ma, who is the daughter of the big star Bagbagak, and
S&#299;nag&#8212;the moon. In this same tale Apon&#299;bolinayen <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1492"></a>Page 26</span>appears as the first wife of Apon&#299;tolau, and it is clear that in the mind of the story teller she is not identified with S&#299;nag.
Apon&#299;tolau appears in the other tales without any hint of celestial qualities. Aside from her name and the fact that she is
once pictured as visiting the sky, there is nothing to indicate that his wife Apon&#299;bolinayen is to be considered as the moon.
A careful study of the other characters who reside in Kadalayapan and Kaodanan fails to yield any evidence that they are considered
as celestial beings.

</p>
<p id="d0e1494">During the <i>Sayang</i> ceremony held in San Juan, a certain man and woman, who are then called Iwagin&aacute;n and Gimbagon<a id="d0e1499src" href="#d0e1499" class="noteref">62</a>, represent the good spirits and are defended by the people when evil spirits try to dispossess them of their property. This
is the only instance I have observed in which the names of any of these characters of the tales appear in the ceremonies,
while a list of more than one hundred and fifty spirits known to the Tinguian fails to reveal more.

</p>
<p id="d0e1502">While in the practice of magic, and in their communication with nature, celestial bodies, and spirits, these &#8220;people of the
first times&#8221; far excelled the present Tinguian, they had a material culture and ceremonial life much like that still found
in Abra.

</p>
<p id="d0e1504">It seems then that these people, about whom the stories cluster, are not to be identified as celestial beings or spirits<a id="d0e1506src" href="#d0e1506" class="noteref">63</a>. They appear rather as generalized heroes whose life and deeds represent that of an earlier period, magnified and extolled
by succeeding generations.

</p><a id="d0e1527"></a><h2>Ritualistic and Explanatory Myths</h2>
<p id="d0e1530">The second division of the tales now assumes a position of importance to us, for in it we find present day ideas and beliefs
of the people strongly brought out, and are thus in a position to contrast them with the tenets of the people in &#8220;the first
times&#8221;.

</p>
<p id="d0e1532">The influence of custom is exceedingly strong among the Tinguian of to-day. The fact that the ancestors did so and so is sufficient
justification for performing any act for which they have no definite explanation. Nowhere is this influence greater than in
the ceremonies. These, which accompany all the important happenings in their daily life, are conducted by mediums who are
fitted for office by long training, and each one of whom is a check on the others if they wilfully or through carelessness
deviate from the old forms. The ritual of these ceremonies is very <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1534"></a>Page 27</span>complex and the reason for doing many acts now seems to be entirely lost, yet the one explanation <i>&#8220;kada&uacute;yan&#8221;</i>&#8212;custom&#8212;is sufficient to satisfy any Tinguian. Other acts, as well as the possession of certain things, are explained by myths,
such as we are considering. It seems certain that we are here dealing not with present day beliefs alone, but with at least
relatively old customs and tales, which while enabling us to understand present day conceptions also give us a glimpse into
the past.

</p>
<p id="d0e1539">The myths 32&#8211;40, which are known to the people as <i>d&#299;ams</i>, are now inseparable parts of the various ceremonies. Thus, when a pig is to be offered in the <i>Sayang</i> ceremony, the medium sits down beside it and strokes it with oiled fingers while she &#8220;talks to the spirits&#8221;. The translation
of her &#8220;talk&#8221; shows that this is in no sense a prayer but is rather an account of how the greatest of the spirits taught the
Tinguian people to perform this ceremony correctly. Likewise, when she offers food in the <i>Dawak</i><a id="d0e1549src" href="#d0e1549" class="noteref">64</a> ceremony, she relates how the spirit Kabon&#299;yan taught the Tinguian to do this in the same manner that he performs it. In
the <i>Pala-an<a id="d0e1557src" href="#d0e1557" class="noteref">65</a> d&#299;am</i> she relates, in story form, the cause of the sickness, but in this case ends with a direct invocation to the spirits in Dad&aacute;ya
to &#8220;make them well again if you please&#8221;. The balance of the <i>d&#299;ams</i>, 35&#8211;40, are in story form, and seem intended more as an explanation to the people as to the causes of their troubles than
to be directed toward the spirits. However, the medium seldom has an audience, and rarely ever a single listener, as she recites
the <i>d&#299;ams</i> she has learned verbatim from her instructors when preparing for the duties of her office.

</p>
<p id="d0e1570">Myths 41&#8211;54 are of quite a different type. They are generally told by the mediums or wise old people, during the ceremonies,
but always to a crowd of eager listeners. They are not learned word for word, as are the <i>d&#299;ams</i>, but their content is constant and they are thoroughly believed.

</p>
<p id="d0e1575">That they exert a great influence on the beliefs and conduct of both old and young is undoubted. The evil which befalls a
person who molests the guardian stones is thus made known even to the children who generally keep at a distance from the grove
in which they stand. Again, these tales give sharp warning as to what befalls a person who even ignorantly breaks the taboos
following a death; but at the same time advance means of thwarting the wrath of the enraged or evil spirits.

</p>
<p id="d0e1577">Myths 55 to 62 at first glance to not appear to be explanatory at all, but seem rather to be a series of stories dealing with
the relations between certain persons and the natural spirits or those of the dead. However, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1579"></a>Page 28</span>it is the intent and use rather than the form of these stories which has caused them to be included in this division, for
they give the people authority for certain beliefs and conceptions which they hold. Tale 56 gives us a glimpse of the prevalent
idea of the abode of the dead, where the spirits lead much the same sort of life as they did while alive, but we secure quite
a different picture of this realm from the Baluga<a id="d0e1581src" href="#d0e1581" class="noteref">66</a> tale, in which the home of the deceased is said to be in the ground while the &#8220;life&#8221; of the dead woman is kept in a bamboo
cup. This last account was heard in Manabo, a town near to the Igorot settlements of the Upit river, and may be influenced
by the beliefs held in that section.<a id="d0e1586src" href="#d0e1586" class="noteref">67</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e1589">Certain individuals appear to have intimate dealings with the natural spirits, in some instances even being joined to them
in marriage. The afterbirth child, Sayen, is believed to have lived &#8220;not very long ago&#8221;, yet we find his life and actions
quite similar to those of the heroes in &#8220;the first times&#8221;, while his foster mother&#8212;the <i>alan</i><a id="d0e1593src" href="#d0e1593" class="noteref">68</a>&#8212;takes the same part as did the <i>alan</i> of old.

</p>
<p id="d0e1602">Relations <a id="d0e1604" href="#d0e7519">63</a> to <a id="d0e1607" href="#d0e7615">74</a> appear as pure explanatory tales, accounting for the existence and appearance of celestial bodies and animals in their present
state; they also account for the possession of fire and of many prized objects, such as jars and agate beads. Incidentally
many essential traits and old customs come out, such, for instance, as those of war and mourning, which appear in connection
with the origin of the <i>kalau</i><a id="d0e1612src" href="#d0e1612" class="noteref">69</a>.

</p>
<p id="d0e1617">With few exceptions the myths of this division correspond to present beliefs; the spirits are those known to-day; the towns
mentioned are now existing or their former locations are well known. They have thus the appearance of being of more recent
origin than those of the first division, yet it is worthy of note that there is little in them which seems foreign to or out
of keeping with the older tales.

</p><a id="d0e1619"></a><h2>Fables</h2>
<p id="d0e1622">The last division may be said to be made up of fables, for the story tellers without hesitation label them as fictions. The
last of these appears to be only a worked over incident of myth <a id="d0e1624" href="#d0e7280">56</a>, in which the big bird Banog carries the hero to its nest, from which he escapes by holding to the wings of the young birds.
It is possible that more of these fables are likewise incidents in tales prevalent among the Tinguian, but not heard by the
writer. Whether or no this be true, it is certain that most of these <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1627"></a>Page 29</span>stories are well known to the Ilocano of the coast and the other Christianized natives throughout the archipelago. Comparison
with the folk-lore from other regions shows that these stories are by no means confined to the Philippines. The chief incidents
in the narrative of the turtle and the monkey have been recorded from the Kenyah of Borneo<a id="d0e1629src" href="#d0e1629" class="noteref">70</a> and from the northern peninsula of Celebes<a id="d0e1637src" href="#d0e1637" class="noteref">71</a>; the race between the shell and the carabao is told in British North Borneo<a id="d0e1651src" href="#d0e1651" class="noteref">72</a> in regard to the plandok and crab, while it is known to European children as the race between the turtle and the hare. The
threat of the mosquito in <a id="d0e1659" href="#d0e7775">84</a> is almost identical with that recorded by Evans in Borneo<a id="d0e1662src" href="#d0e1662" class="noteref">73</a>; while many incidents in the fable of Dogidog<a id="d0e1668src" href="#d0e1668" class="noteref">74</a> are found in the Iban story of Simpang Impang<a id="d0e1673src" href="#d0e1673" class="noteref">75</a>.

</p>
<p id="d0e1681">When comparing the Tinguian versions of these fables with those of the Ilocano, one is impressed with the fact that while
the incidents upon which they are founded are often identical, the stories themselves have frequently been moulded and changed
by the tellers, who have introduced bits of old customs and beliefs until they reflect, in a way, the prevalent ideas of the
people. Thus in the story of the magic <i>poncho</i><a id="d0e1685src" href="#d0e1685" class="noteref">76</a>, which is evidently of Spanish introduction, the owner is identified as the <i>banbantay</i>&#8212;a well-known minor spirit. Again, the first part of tale 85 is identical with that of the Ilocano, but ends with the parents
of the groom preparing the things used in the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>&#8212;a very necessary part of the Tinguian marriage ceremony.

</p>
<p id="d0e1705">The footnotes have called attention to the many incidents which have their parallels in other districts. Reference to these
shows that a large percentage are found in the islands toward the south. While recognizing that similarity of incidents does
not necessarily mean identity of origin, we must still give full credit to the effects of borrowing, even over great distances.
The easy communication along the coast during the past four hundred years and the contact with Spanish and Christianized officials
and traders will readily explain the likeness of the tales in Division III <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1707"></a>Page 30</span>to those held in distant islands, or even in Europe, but, as just noted, these are now undergoing change. Doubtless a similar
inflow had been taking place, although at a slower rate, long before the Spaniards reached the Islands, and Tinguian mythology
has grown up as the result of blending of native tales with those of other areas, the whole being worked over and reshaped
until it fitted the social setting.

</p>
<p id="d0e1709">Previous writers&#8212;among them Ratzel and Graebner<a id="d0e1711src" href="#d0e1711" class="noteref">77</a>&#8212;have sought to account for certain resemblances in culture, between Malaysia, Polynesia, and America, by historical connection.
A part of our material&#8212;such as that of the blood-clot child (<a id="d0e1725" href="#d0e4897">p. 125</a>),<a id="d0e1728src" href="#d0e1728" class="noteref">78</a> the rape of the maiden by the vine which carries her to the sky (<a id="d0e1737" href="#d0e1845">p. 33</a>),<a href="#d0e1728" class="noteref">78</a> the magic flight (<a id="d0e1742" href="#d0e3355">p. 75</a>),<a href="#d0e1728" class="noteref">78</a> and magic growth (<a id="d0e1747" href="#d0e1988">p. 38</a>)<a id="d0e1750src" href="#d0e1750" class="noteref">79</a>&#8212;may seem to lend support to such a theory. These similarities are assuredly suggestive and interesting, but it appears to
the writer that the material is too scanty and the folklore of intervening lands too little known to justify us in considering
them as convincing proof of borrowing over such immense distances.<a id="d0e1765src" href="#d0e1765" class="noteref">80</a>

</p><a id="d0e1795"></a><h2>General Results</h2>
<p id="d0e1798">Our study has brought out certain general results. We have seen that Tinguian folklore has much in common with that of other
tribes and lands. While a part of this similarity is doubtless due to borrowing&#8212;a process which can still be seen at work&#8212;a
considerable portion of the tales is probably of local and fairly recent origin, while the balance appears to be very old.
These older tales are so intimately interwoven with the ceremonies, beliefs, and culture of this people that they may safely
be considered as having been developed by them. They are doubtless much influenced by present day conditions, for each story
teller must, even unconsciously, read into them some of his own experiences and the current beliefs of the tribe. At the same
time these traditional accounts doubtless exercise a potent influence on the thoughts, beliefs, and actions of the people.
In Tinguian society, where custom still <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1800"></a>Page 31</span>holds undisputed sway, these well-known tales of past times must tend to cast into the same mould any new facts or experiences
which come to them.

</p>
<p id="d0e1802">We believe that we are justified when we take the viewpoint of the Tinguian and consider &#8220;the stories of the first times&#8221;
as essentially very old. How old it is impossible to state definitely, but a careful analysis of our material justifies us
in believing that they reflect a time before the people possessed terraced rice fields, when domestic work animals were still
unknown, and the horse had not yet been introduced into their land. That these are not recent events is attested by the great
part they all now play in the ceremonial and economic life. It is evident that outside influences of great importance were
introduced at a period later than the time when the Chinese first began to trade along the coasts of the Philippines for the
prized jars, which play such an important r&ocirc;le in the mythology, are not to be identified as those of native make but are
ancient Chinese vessels dating back at least to the fourteenth and perhaps even to the tenth century<a id="d0e1804src" href="#d0e1804" class="noteref">81</a>.

</p>
<p id="d0e1815">It is probable that the glass, porcelain, and agate beads, which are second only to the jars in importance, are exceedingly
old. Many ancient specimens are still in use and are held for as fabulous prices as are those found among the interior tribes
of Borneo. Nieuwenhuis has shown that the manufacture of beads had become a great industry in the middle ages, and had extended
even to China and Japan, whence the products may have spread contemporaneously with the pottery<a id="d0e1817src" href="#d0e1817" class="noteref">82</a>.

</p>
<p id="d0e1828">We have seen that, for the most part, the life, customs, and beliefs which appear in our reconstruction of &#8220;the first times&#8221;
agrees closely with present conditions; certain things which seem formerly to have been of prime importance&#8212;such as the sending
of a betel-nut covered with gold to invite guests to a festival or ceremony&#8212;appear to have their echo in present conditions.
The betel-nut which played such a momentous part in the old times still holds its place in the rituals of the many ceremonies,
although it is not now much used in daily life. The magic of to-day is less powerful than formerly, but is still a tremendous
force. The communication of the ancient people with other members of the animate world, as well as with the inanimate and
spiritual, and their metamorphosis into animals and the like, offers nothing strange or inconsistent to the people of to-day.
They even now talk to jars, they converse with spirits who come to them through the bodies of their mediums, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1830"></a>Page 32</span>and people only recently deceased are known to have had the power of changing themselves, at will, into other forms.

</p>
<p id="d0e1832">In short, there is no sharp break between the mode of thought of to-day and that exhibited in the folklore. It is true that
the tales give sanction to some things not in agreement with Tinguian usage&#8212;such, for instance, as the marriage of relatives,
or the method of disposing of the dead&#8212;and it may be that we have here a remembrance of customs which long ago fell into disuse.


</p>
<p id="d0e1834">In a previous paper<a id="d0e1836src" href="#d0e1836" class="noteref">83</a> the writer showed that there have been many migrations into Abra from the north, south, and west. A part of the emigrants
have become thoroughly amalgamated with the Tinguian people and have doubtless introduced some part of their material culture
and beliefs. This helps us to understand such conflicts as we have already noted in regard to the place held by thunder and
lightning in the spirit world, as to the future abode of the spirits of the departed, as well as other discrepancies which
the limits of this paper have prevented us from discussing.

</p>
<p id="d0e1841">It is not impossible that those customs of &#8220;the first times,&#8221; which are at variance with those of to-day, may represent older
ideas which have been swamped, or, on the other hand, the memory of the strange customs once practiced by the emigrants may
have caused them to be attributed to the people of the tales.

</p>
<p id="d0e1843">Finally, we believe that a study of Tinguian mythology has shown us that we can gain a real knowledge of the past of a people
through their folklore; that we can secure an insight into their mental life; and can learn something of the valuation they
attach to certain of their activities and beliefs, which to us may seem at the surface trite and trivial.

<p id="d0e1911">When afternoon came, Ini-init went home to his house after he finished fishing. He saw his house, which appeared as if it
was burning, not slowly. He went home because it appeared as if his house was burning. When he arrived at his house, it was
not burning, and he was surprised because it appeared as if there was a flame at the place of his bed. When he was in his
house, he saw that which was like the flame of the fire, at the place of his bed, was a very pretty lady.

</p>
<p id="d0e1913">Soon he cooked, and when he had finished to cook he scaled the fish, and when he had finished scaling he cut it into many
pieces, and he made a noise on the bamboo floor when he cut the fish. The woman awoke, who was asleep on his bed. She saw
that the man who cut the fish was a handsome man, and that he dragged his hair.<a id="d0e1915src" href="#d0e1915" class="noteref">7</a> The pot she had used to cook in looked like the egg of a rooster<a id="d0e1918src" href="#d0e1918" class="noteref">8</a> and he was surprised because it looked like the egg of a rooster; and the rice which she cooked was one grain of broken rice.<a id="d0e1931src" href="#d0e1931" class="noteref">9</a> Because of all this Ini-init was surprised, for the pot was very small with which she cooked. After Ini-init cooked, the
woman vanished and she went to the leaves of the betel-nut, where she went to hide.

</p>
<p id="d0e1937">After Ini-init finished cooking the fish, he saw the bed, the place where the woman was sleeping, was empty. He was looking
continually, but he did not find her. When he could not find her, he ate alone, and when he finished eating he washed, and
when he finished washing the dishes he put away, and when he had finished putting away he went to the yard to get a fresh
breath.

</p>
<p id="d0e1939">Not long afterwards he went to take a walk in the place of his betel-nuts. When he had finished to take a walk in the place
of his betel-nuts, he went to sleep.

</p>
<p id="d0e1941">When it began to be early morning, he left his house, he who went up, because it was his business to make the sun. And Apon&#299;bolinayen
went again into the house.

</p>
<p id="d0e1943">When it became afternoon, Ini-init went to his home, and Apon&#299;bolinayen had cooked, after which she went out to the betel-nut
trees. When Ini-init arrived, he was surprised because his food was cooked, for there was no person in his house. As soon
as he saw the cooked rice and cooked fish in the dish, he took the fish and the rice and began to eat. When he <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1945"></a>Page 35</span>had finished eating, he went to his yard to take a fresh breath and he was troubled in his mind when he thought of what had
happened. He said, &#8220;Perhaps the woman, which I saw, came to cook and has left the house. Sometime I shall try to hide and
watch, so that I may catch her.&#8221; He went to sleep, and when it became early morning he went to cook his food. When he had
finished eating, he went again to make the sun, and Apon&#299;bolinayen went again to his house.

</p>
<p id="d0e1947">When the sun had nearly sunk, he sent the big star who was next to follow him in the sky, and he went home to spy on the woman.
When he had nearly reached his home, he saw the house appeared as if it was burning.<a id="d0e1949src" href="#d0e1949" class="noteref">10</a> He walked softly when he went up the ladder. He slammed shut the door. He reached truly the woman who was cooking in the
house. He went quickly and the woman said to him, &#8220;You cut me only once, so that I only cure one time, if you are the old
enemy.&#8221; &#8220;If I were the old enemy, I should have cut before,&#8221; said Ini-init, and he sat near her who cooked. He took out the
betel-nut, and he arranged it so that they began to chew the betel-nut, and he said, &#8220;Ala! young lady, we are going to chew,
because it is bad for us to talk who do not know each other's names.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen answered, &#8220;No, for if the rich man who practices magic is able to give to the rich woman who has magical power,
soon there will be a sign.&#8221; Ini-init said, &#8220;No, hurry up even though we are related, for you come here if we are not related.&#8221;<a id="d0e1958src" href="#d0e1958" class="noteref">11</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e1961">He begged her and he cut the betel-nut, which was to be chewed, which was covered with gold, and he gave it to the woman who
had magical power, and they chewed. When she laid down the quid, it looked like the agate bead, which has no hole for the
thread. And the quid of Ini-init looked like a square bead.

</p>
<p id="d0e1963">&#8220;My name is Ini-init, who often goes to travel over the world. I always stop in the afternoon. What can I do, it is my business,&#8221;
he said. Apon&#299;bolinayen was next to tell her name. &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;bolinayen, who lives in Kaodanan, who am the sister of
Awig,&#8221; she said, and when they had finished telling their names, both their quids looked like the agate bead which is <i>pinoglan</i>, which has no hole. Ini-init said, &#8220;We are relatives, and it is good for us to be married. Do not be afraid even though you
did not come here of your own accord. I go to Kaodanan,&#8221; he said. Then they married, and the sun went to shine on the world,
because it was his business, and the big star also had business when it became night. Apon&#299;bolinayen staid alone in the house,
and in the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1968"></a>Page 36</span>afternoon the sun again went home, but first he went to fish in the river. He went home when he had caught the big fish for
them to eat&#8212;both those married. And when he arrived in their house he found Apon&#299;bolinayen, who was cooking, and he saw that
she still broke up the fish-stick, which she cooked. Ini-init asked her, &#8220;What are you doing with that stick which you are
breaking, which you put in the jar?&#8221; and Apon&#299;bolinayen replied, &#8220;I cook for us both to eat,&#8221; and the sun laughed, because
she cooked the stick. &#8220;You throw away that stick which you are cooking; this fish which I caught with the net is what you
are to cook. It is not eatable that fish-stick which you cook,&#8221; he said. Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;You shall see by and by, when
we eat, what it will become. You hang up the fish which you caught, which we shall eat to-morrow.&#8221; &#8220;Hurry up! You throw away
that stick which you cook, it has no use. Even though you cook for one month, it will not become soft, and I do not think
it will become good,&#8221; said Ini-init. Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;No, you hurry and hang that fish which you caught with the net,
because it is nearly cooked&#8212;the rice and the fish.&#8221; Not long after she took out the rice from the jar, and she uncovered her
cooked fish, which was a stick. When the sun saw that the fish came from the stick which she cooked, he was surprised and
he asked her how she made the stick, which she cooked, turn to fish. Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;You hurry come and eat, for I have
finished taking out the rice and fish.&#8221;<a id="d0e1970src" href="#d0e1970" class="noteref">12</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e1976">Not long after that the sun went truly in front of her to the place of the rice and cooked fish, and they ate.

</p>
<p id="d0e1978">Not long after they finished and Apon&#299;bolinayen washed, and when she had finished washing she put away those things which
they ate and Ini-init made trouble because of the stick which became a fish. He again asked Apon&#299;bolinayen how she made the
stick into fish, and Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;Do not trouble yourself, perhaps you know about the rich woman who practices magic
in Kaodanan,&#8221; and Ini-init said, &#8220;Yes, I know the rich woman who practices magic in Kaodanan, who sometimes has much power,
who changes, who has no equal.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;Why do you still ask if you know?&#8221; &#8220;I ask because I want to be sure,
even though I know you have much power,&#8221; said Ini-init. &#8220;If that is true, do not ask again,&#8221; she said. Not long after while
they were talking, they went to sleep, and when it began to be early morning Ini-init went to make the sun on all the world;
when they had finished to eat he went to shine. Apon&#299;bolinayen staid in the house. When it came afternoon, the sun went down
and he went directly to fish in the river, for the fish which they ate&#8212;the two who were married. Not long <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1980"></a>Page 37</span>after he caught again a big fish, and he went home. When he arrived, Apon&#299;bolinayen had finished cooking, and he asked where
she got the fish which she had cooked, and she said, &#8220;Why do you ask again? You know it is the stick which I cook, which is
fish, which we ate, before you arrived again with fish. Throw away the fish which you caught, for this stick is many fish
which I cook.&#8221; After that Ini-init said, &#8220;Why do you order to throw away, that which serves the purpose to which we put it,
even though you cook many sticks?&#8221; &#8220;If you value it, hang it on the hanger, and you come and eat.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e1982">Not long after they ate, and when they had finished eating, they washed, and when they had finished washing those things which
they used to eat on, they talked and they went to sleep.

</p>
<p id="d0e1984">When it became the middle of the night, Apon&#299;bolinayen woke up. &#8220;I go up with you when you go up in the early morning,&#8221; she
said. Ini-init said to her, &#8220;Do not come, for it is very hot up above. You cannot endure the heat, and you will repent when
we are there.&#8221; &#8220;No, if it is too hot, we shall take many blankets and pillows, which I shall go under,&#8221; she said again and
again until it became early morning, then Ini-init agreed. They ate first and then they arranged those pillows and blankets
which they took with them.

</p>
<p id="d0e1986">Not long after they went east, and when they arrived there the sun shone, and Apon&#299;bolinayen became oil because it was so
hot, and Ini-init put her in a bottle, and he corked it and covered it with blankets and pillows, which sheltered her, and
he dropped it down. She fell by the well in Kaodanan, and Indi&aacute;pan, who was still dipping water, turned her face at the sound
of the falling at her side. She saw many good blankets and pillows, and she unwrapped that which was wrapped, and when she
had finished to unwrap she saw it was a pretty lady&#8212;none equal to her&#8212;and she was frightened. She went quickly to go up to
the town, where they lived, and when she arrived there she said to the people, &#8220;We have been searching a long time for Apon&#299;bolinayen,
and you killed and used many cows as food for the searchers, and you spent much for her. She is at the spring. I was frightened
when she fell by me, who was dipping water from the well. I saw many pretty blankets and pillows, and I unwrapped that which
was wrapped, and it was Apon&#299;bolinayen whom we are seeking,&#8221; said Indi&aacute;pan. They went quickly&#8212;her father and mother&#8212;and the
other men went to see her, and when they arrived at the place of the well they saw Apon&#299;bolinayen whom they sought. &#8220;Where
did you come from, Apon&#299;bolinayen, for whom we have been seeking? We have invited many and have fed many to search for you.
Among the towns there is not one we did not search for you, and now you are here,&#8221; said her father and mother. She said, &#8220;I
came from <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e1988"></a>Page 38</span>Pindayan. I nearly did not come, because the <i>alzados</i><a id="d0e1992src" href="#d0e1992" class="noteref">13</a> closed the way, and I escaped while they slept.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e1998">Not long after they went up to the town, and not long after they went to wash their hair and bathe in the river, and when
they had finished washing their hair they went home.

</p>
<p id="d0e2000">Ebang said, &#8220;Ala! husband Pagatip&aacute;nan, let us make <i>balaua</i><a id="d0e2004src" href="#d0e2004" class="noteref">14</a> and invite our relatives who are sorrowing for Apon&#299;bolinayen,&#8221; and Pagatip&aacute;nan said, &#8220;We shall make <i>balaua</i> when next month comes, but now Apon&#299;bolinayen feels ill, perhaps she is tired.&#8221; Not long after that Apon&#299;bolinayen commanded them to prick her little finger which itched; and when her mother pricked it
out popped a pretty baby.<a id="d0e2016src" href="#d0e2016" class="noteref">15</a> Her mother asked, &#8220;Where did you get this baby, Apon&#299;bolinayen?&#8221; But Apon&#299;bolinayen did not tell. &#8220;I do not know where I
got it, and I did not feel,&#8221; she said. When they could not compel her to tell where she secured the baby, &#8220;Ala, we make <i>balaua</i> to-morrow,&#8221; said the father and mother.

</p>
<p id="d0e2025">They made <i>balaua</i>, and not long after Ebang used magic, so that many people went to pound rice for them, and when they had finished to pound
rice they built <i>balaua</i>, and they went to get the betel-nut which is covered with gold for chewing. When these arrived, Ebang oiled them when it
began to get dark. &#8220;You betel-nuts go to all the people in the whole world and invite them. If any of them do not come, you
grow on their knees,&#8221; said Ebang. And those betel-nuts went to invite all the people in the whole world. Every time they bathed
the child they used magic, so that it grew as often as they washed it, until it walked. The betel-nuts arrived in the towns
where they went to invite. The one that went to Nagbotobot&aacute;n&#8212;the place where lived the old woman Alokot&aacute;n&#8212;said, &#8220;Good morning,
I do not tarry, the reason of my coming is that Ebang and Pagatip&aacute;nan commanded me, because Apon&#299;bolinayen is there.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,
you go first, I will come, I will follow you. I go first to wash my hair and bathe,&#8221; she said. The betel-nut which is covered
with gold said, &#8220;I wait for you, for if you do not come, I shall grow on your knee.&#8221; The old woman Alokot&aacute;n started when she
finished washing her hair and bathing. The betel-nut, which was covered with gold, took her, and not long after they arrived,
and they met those whom the other betel-nuts went to summon in the other towns. No one wanted the baby to go to them,<a id="d0e2033src" href="#d0e2033" class="noteref">16</a> and when none wished it <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2036"></a>Page 39</span>to approach, the old woman Alokot&aacute;n summoned the spirits. (&#8220;What town did they not yet invite?&#8221; This question was added by
the story-teller. Not part of tale.) The old woman Alokot&aacute;n said, &#8220;You invited all the people except Ini-init, who is above.
You did not send the prepared betel-nut covered with gold to summon him. Perhaps he made Apon&#299;bolinayen pregnant, because
the <i>siksiklat</i> took her up when they went to gather greens&#8212;she and her sister-in-law, who is Dinay.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e2041">They commanded the betel-nuts, and they oiled them, and sent them. Not long after the betel-nut, whom they sent, arrived above,
who went to call Ini-init. And the betel-nut said, when he arrived, &#8220;Good morning, Sun, I do not tarry. The reason of my visit
is that Ebang and Pagatip&aacute;nan, who make <i>balaua</i>, send me. If you do not wish to come, I will grow on your head.&#8221; The sun said, &#8220;Grow on my head, I do not wish to go.&#8221; The
betel-nut jumped up and went on his head, and it grew. Not long after the betel-nut became tall and the sun was not able to
carry it, because it became big, and he was in pain. &#8220;You go to my pig, that is what you grow on,&#8221; he said. Not long after
the betel-nut jumped on the head of his pig, and the pig began to squeal because it could not carry the betel-nut which began
to grow on its head. And Ini-init said, &#8220;Ala! get off my big pig and I come.&#8221; The betel-nut got off the pig.

</p>
<p id="d0e2046">Not long after they went and Pagatip&aacute;nan carried the baby near to the gate. When Ini-init and the betel-nut approached, the
baby was happy and he went to be carried by Ini-init. When they arrived at the festival place, the people saw that he who
carried the baby rolled because he was round, and they saw he was not a man but a stone, and Ebang and Pagatip&aacute;nan said, &#8220;Ala!
Apon&#299;bolinayen, you start and take off your arm beads and you dress in rags, you wrap your wrists with strings, in place of
the arm beads, so that you can go with the stone when he takes you to his home, when our <i>balaua</i> is finished.&#8221; Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen started. She took off her beads and her dresses and exchanged them for rags and strings. When
she changed her dresses, she went down the ladder, and she saw that he who carried the baby was a stone, which was round.
After that Pagatip&aacute;nan said, &#8220;Ala! now our <i>balaua</i> is finished, you go home to the town of the stone.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;Yes, if that is what you say.&#8221; Those people who
were invited bade them good-by, and when they went away, they went home also&#8212;those whom they invited.

</p>
<p id="d0e2057">Not long after they arrived at their home and the sun became a man, he who had been a stone before. &#8220;When next month comes
we shall build <i>balaua</i>, Apon&#299;bolinayen, so that we can invite our relatives, and <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2062"></a>Page 40</span>I will pay the marriage price, because I marry you,&#8221;<a id="d0e2064src" href="#d0e2064" class="noteref">17</a> said Ini-init to her. Soon the month arrived in which they said they would build <i>balaua</i>, and they summoned the old woman Alokot&aacute;n, to start the <i>balaua</i>. Not long after they sent to get <i>bolo</i> and <i>lono</i><a id="d0e2081src" href="#d0e2081" class="noteref">18</a> with which to make the <i>dak&#299;dak</i> and <i>talap&#299;tap</i>.<a id="d0e2090src" href="#d0e2090" class="noteref">19</a> When it became afternoon the old woman Alokot&aacute;n began to sing <i>da-eng</i><a id="d0e2098src" href="#d0e2098" class="noteref">20</a> and the next night they sang <i>da-eng</i> again. Not long after they commanded to pound rice, and Apon&#299;bolinayen used magic so that many women went to pound with them.<a id="d0e2107src" href="#d0e2107" class="noteref">21</a> And Ini-init practiced magic so that they had many neighbors, and many who went to pound rice with them.

</p>
<p id="d0e2110">Soon they commanded to get the timbers for the <i>balaua</i>, and they prepared everything which they needed. When it became morning they built <i>balaua</i>, and not long after they went to get the prepared betel-nut, which is covered with gold, which they sent to invite their
relatives.<a id="d0e2118src" href="#d0e2118" class="noteref">22</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e2124">When they arrived&#8212;those prepared betel-nuts which were covered with gold&#8212;they oiled them at the beginning of the night, and
sent them to invite. Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;I will use magic, so that you, betel-nut, may reach the town of our relatives so
that you invite all of them. When there is one who will not come, you grow on their knees, as long as they do not come.&#8221; Not
long after they made <i>Libon</i><a id="d0e2128src" href="#d0e2128" class="noteref">23</a> in the beginning of the night.

</p>
<p id="d0e2134">Those betel-nuts, whom they sent to invite, arrived, those which they sent to invite their relatives. They did not wish to
go to make <i>balaua</i>. The betel-nuts who went to invite them said, &#8220;If you do not wish to come, I will grow on your knee.&#8221; Pagatip&aacute;nan said, &#8220;You
grow,&#8221; and the betel-nut grew on his knee, and it became high and he was in pain. &#8220;Ala! you get off my knee, and you go on
my pig,&#8221; he said, and the betel-nut went truly on his pig and it squealed. &#8220;You get off my pig, and we will come,&#8221; he said,
and the betel-nut truly got off the pig. &#8220;Ala! you who live in the same town, you go and wash your hair and bathe, and wash
your clothes so that we can go to make <i>Sayang</i><a id="d0e2141src" href="#d0e2141" class="noteref">24</a> with the stone and Apon&#299;bolinayen. Here is a betel-nut covered with gold which they send,&#8221; said Pagatip&aacute;nan. And the people
who lived in <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2147"></a>Page 41</span>the same town washed their hair and bathed, and they went to wash their clothes. Not long after it became afternoon and Pagatip&aacute;nan
used magic so that cake and singed pig appeared which they were to take to those who make <i>Sayang</i>, which they exchanged with those who make <i>Sayang</i>.<a id="d0e2155src" href="#d0e2155" class="noteref">25</a> Not long after they arrived at the place of the gathering, and Apon&#299;bolinayen and Ini-init went to make <i>alawig</i>,<a id="d0e2161src" href="#d0e2161" class="noteref">26</a> and when they had finished, they brought them up to the town. Pagatip&aacute;nan said, &#8220;I did not think that the stone which rolled
could change when he came to make <i>balaua</i> with us.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e2167">&#8220;<i>Ala</i>! now all you who have arrived, rich men, you divide the prepared betel-nut which is covered with gold,&#8221; said Ini-init. Not
long after Pagatip&aacute;nan cut the betel-nut and chewed, and the quid of Ini-init went to the quid of Pagbok&aacute;san, and the quid
of Apon&#299;bolinayen went to the quid of Pagatip&aacute;nan.<a id="d0e2172src" href="#d0e2172" class="noteref">27</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e2175">&#8220;Ala! now that we have finished chewing, I will give the payment for Apon&#299;bolinayen, and now that you have found out that
I am your son&#8212;father and mother&#8212;let us give the payment,&#8221;<a id="d0e2177src" href="#d0e2177" class="noteref">28</a> said Ini-init.

</p>
<p id="d0e2180">His father and mother said, &#8220;If that is what you say, my child, we will give,&#8221; and they gave him the name of Apon&#299;tolau.<a id="d0e2182src" href="#d0e2182" class="noteref">29</a> And Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;Ala! you play the <i>gansa</i><a id="d0e2190src" href="#d0e2190" class="noteref">30</a> so that we can dance.&#8221; When they played the <i>gansa</i>, Iwaginan took the <i>alap</i> and <i>kinamayan</i><a id="d0e2201src" href="#d0e2201" class="noteref">31</a> and he gave them to Apon&#299;bolinayen and Agyokan. When Apon&#299;bolinayen and Agyokan had finished dancing, they made Apon&#299;tolau
and Asindam&aacute;yan dance. When Apon&#299;tolau and Asindam&aacute;yan finished dancing he made to dance Dinay of Kabis&#299;lan, who was the daughter
of Dalon&aacute;gan, and also they made to dance Kanag,<a id="d0e2204src" href="#d0e2204" class="noteref">32</a> who was the son of Apon&#299;bolinayen and Apon&#299;tolau. When they finished to dance, Datalan and Dalon&aacute;gan of Kabis&#299;lan danced,
and when they finished to dance, Iwaginan made Dagapan and Indi&aacute;pan dance. When they had finished dancing Gint&#7431;ban and Agyokan
were next. And the beads of Gint&#7431;ban were jars, which struck together while they danced. Next were Iwaginan and Kindi-i&ntilde;an
who <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2207"></a>Page 42</span>was the wife of Ilw&#299;san of Dagapan. And when they had all danced they stopped playing the <i>gansa</i>. Apon&#299;tolau gave the payment for Apon&#299;bolinayen and it was the <i>balaua</i> nine times filled with jars&#8212;<i>malayo, tadogan</i>, and <i>ginlasan</i>.<a id="d0e2221src" href="#d0e2221" class="noteref">33</a> And when he had given all the payment they played again on the <i>gansas</i> for one month and they danced.

</p>
<p id="d0e2227">When one month passed, they went home&#8212;their relatives whom they had invited. They said, &#8220;Ala! now Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen,
since the day has arrived on which we go home, do not detain us for we have been here for a month, we go home to our town.&#8221;
Not long after they all went home. And the father and mother of Apon&#299;tolau took them home with them to Kadalayapan, and they
took all their possessions from up above. When they arrived in Kadalayapan those who lived in the same town were surprised,
for Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen were there. They went to see them and Balok&aacute;nag (i.e., Kanag&#8212;their son) was large. It is
said.

<p id="d0e2229">(Told by Magwati, a man of Lagangilang Abra.)

</p><a id="d0e2231"></a><h2>2</h2>
<p id="d0e2234">&#8220;I am anxious to eat the mango fruit which belongs to Algaba of Dag&aacute;la,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. When she said this she was almost
dying and she repeated it. &#8220;Ala cousin Dalon&aacute;gan, you go and take cousin Dina-ogan, and go and secure the mango fruit of Algaba
of Dag&aacute;la,&#8221; said Apon&#299;balagen. &#8220;Why does Apon&#299;bolinayen want the mango fruit of Algaba of Dag&aacute;la; does she not know that anyone
who goes there cannot return?&#8221; asked Dalon&aacute;gan. &#8220;Ala, you go and be careful and he will not hurt you,&#8221; said Apon&#299;balagen.
And Dalon&aacute;gan went truly, and started, and Apon&#299;balagen gave Dalon&aacute;gan a belt and earrings, which he was to trade for the
mango fruit; and Dalon&aacute;gan went to get Dina-ogan, and he took an egg. Not long after they went and they held the egg all the
time as they walked. When they were in the middle of the way the egg hatched. When they had almost arrived in Dag&aacute;la the chicken
had become a rooster which could crow.

</p>
<p id="d0e2236">Not long after they arrived at the spring of Algaba of Dag&aacute;la, and the people who dipped water from the spring were there.
&#8220;You people who are dipping water from the spring, where is a shallow place where we can cross?&#8221; &#8220;Where is the shallow place
where we can cross you say, rich men, perhaps you are enemies,&#8221; said the women who were dipping water. &#8220;If we are enemies
we would kill you,&#8221; said Dalon&aacute;gan. &#8220;You see the shallow place where the people cross,&#8221; said the people <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2238"></a>Page 43</span>who were dipping water from the well. Not long after they spread their belt on the water and they rode across. When they arrived
on the other side of the river they took a bath. As soon as they finished bathing they went on top of a high stone and dried
their bodies. The water which dropped from their bodies became agates which have no holes through them, and the women who
were dipping water saw the agates which dropped from their bodies and they touched each other and said, &#8220;Look at that.&#8221; When
they put their clouts on they asked the women, &#8220;Where is the road to the house of Algaba of Dag&aacute;la?&#8221; &#8220;You follow the <i>sagang</i>;<a id="d0e2243src" href="#d0e2243" class="noteref">34</a> they lead to his house and his <i>balaua</i>,&#8221; said the women who were dipping water from the well. &#8220;Will one of you guide us to the house of our cousin Algaba?&#8221; they
said. &#8220;No, because no one comes to get water unless all are together,&#8221; said the women. Not long after Dalon&aacute;gan and his companion
went up to the town and the defensive fence, which was made of boa constrictors, did not notice them for the snakes slept.
Not long after they arrived at the <i>balaua</i>. &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Wes</span>,&#8221; they said, and the old woman <i>alan</i><a id="d0e2257src" href="#d0e2257" class="noteref">35</a> came to look at them through the window. &#8220;How are you?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do not go to the <i>balaua</i>, because Algaba can see you,&#8221; said the <i>alan</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e2272">Algaba was playing with his sweetheart in the other house, when his sweetheart arrived from the well. &#8220;Your big snakes, which
make the fence, did not see the enemies who came inside of the town.&#8221; Then Algaba ran to his house and he was very angry when
he saw the two men. He went to get his headaxe and spear and when he took them down the weapons shed tears which were of oil.
&#8220;What is the matter with my weapons that they weep oil? Perhaps these men are my relatives,&#8221; said the angry man. He dropped
them and when he took another set they shed bloody tears.

</p>
<p id="d0e2274">The two men went up into the kitchen of the house, and Algaba went there. &#8220;How do you do now?&#8221; he said, still angry. &#8220;What
do you want here?&#8221; &#8220;What are you here for, you ask, and we came to buy the mango fruit for Apon&#299;bolinayen who is nearly dead.&#8221;
&#8220;It is good that you came here,&#8221; said Algaba, but he was angry and the two men were frightened, and they did not eat much.
As soon as they finished eating, &#8220;What do you want to pay?&#8221; said Algaba. They let him see the one earring of Apon&#299;bolinayen.
&#8220;I don't like that; look at the yard of my house. All the stones are gold,&#8221; said Algaba. When he did not want the earring,
they let him see the belt, and Algaba smiled. &#8220;How pretty it is! I think the lady who owns this is much prettier,&#8221; <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2276"></a>Page 44</span>he said to them. &#8220;Ala, you go and get two of the fruit.&#8221; So they went truly, and Dalon&aacute;gan went to climb and when he secured
two mangoes he went down. &#8220;We go now.&#8221; &#8220;I will go with you for I wish to see Apon&#299;bolinayen,&#8221; said Algaba. He said to his
mother <i>alan</i> &#8220;You, mother, do not feel anxious concerning me while I am gone, for I want to go and see the sick lady who so desires the
mango fruit. Watch for enemies who come inside the town.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, do not stay long,&#8221; said his mother <i>alan</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e2284">Not long after they went and when they were in the middle of the way Algaba said, &#8220;Is it far yet?&#8221; &#8220;It is near now,&#8221; they
answered. &#8220;I use my power so that the sick woman, for whom they came to get fruit, will feel very ill and nearly die,&#8221; said
Algaba to himself. Not long after, truly they almost arrived. When they reached the well, he asked again, &#8220;Is it still far?&#8221;
but he knew that the well belonged to Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;It is near now; she owns this well,&#8221; they said. Not long after they
entered the gate of the town. &#8220;I use my power so that Apon&#299;bolinayen will die,&#8221; he said, and she truly died. &#8220;Why is Apon&#299;bolinayen
dead? The mango fruit which we went to get is worthless now,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Perhaps she is the one they are wailing for,&#8221; said
Algaba of Dag&aacute;la. When they reached the ladder, &#8220;The mango fruit which you went to get is no good at all,&#8221; said Apon&#299;balagen
to them. &#8220;Yes, it is. I came because I wish to see her,&#8221; said Algaba of Dag&aacute;la. &#8220;If it is possible for you to bring her to
life, please do so,&#8221; said Apon&#299;balagen to him, and took him inside of the house. Algaba looked at her, and she was a lady
without an equal for beauty. Not long after he took the body in his arms. &#8220;I use my power so that when I whip my perfume<a id="d0e2286src" href="#d0e2286" class="noteref">36</a> <i>kaladakad</i> she will move directly,&#8221; he said, and the body moved. &#8220;I use my power so that when I whip my perfume <i>banaw&#7431;s</i> she will say &#8216;<span class="smallcaps">Wes</span>&#8217;&#8221; and she at once said &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Wes</span>.&#8221; &#8220;I use my power so that when I whip my perfume she will wake up,&#8221; and she woke up. &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Wes</span>, how long my sleep was!&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen, for she was alive again. &#8220;How long I sleep! you say. You have been dead,&#8221; said
Algaba, and Apon&#299;bolinayen looked at him and she it saw was not Apon&#299;balagen who held her in his arms. &#8220;Why, Apon&#299;balagen,
do you detest me? Another man is holding me,&#8221; she said, and she arose from his arms, because she was ashamed.  &#8220;Do not leave
me, lady; you would have been dead a long time if I had not come,&#8221; said Algaba, and their rings exchanged of themselves while
he was holding her and when Apon&#299;bolinayen had regained her breath, Algaba divided the mango fruit into two parts and he gave
to Apon&#299;bolinayen, but she did not want to take <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2307"></a>Page 45</span>it for she was ashamed. &#8220;If you do not wish to eat this fruit which I give you, you cannot go to anyone but me,&#8221; said Algaba,
and Apon&#299;balagen left them alone.

</p>
<p id="d0e2309">Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen could sit up straight, and she wanted to leave Algaba, but he took her. When Apon&#299;bolinayen
looked at her ring she saw it was not her own. &#8220;Why have I another ring?&#8221; she asked, and she caught the hand of Algaba for
he wanted to take her. &#8220;Give me my ring. It is not good for you, for it looks like copper. Take your ring, for it is really
gold,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;No, this is good, for I did not take it from your finger. The spirits wanted it to come to my
finger. Our rings are both gold, but they are different colors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let us chew betel-nut for it is bad for us to talk
when we do not know each other's names.&#8221; &#8220;It is not my custom to chew betel-nut,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;Then you learn,&#8221; said
Algaba. Not long after he made her chew and he gave to her. &#8220;Now, lady, whom I visit you tell your name first,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No,
because I am ashamed, as a woman to tell my name first.&#8221; Not long after he said, &#8220;My name is Algaba of Dag&aacute;la. I have looked
in all parts of the world for a wife, but I did not find anyone like you, and now I have found you, and I want you to be married
to me.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;bolinayen of Kaodanan, sister of Apon&#299;balagen who are son and daughter of Ebang and Pagbok&aacute;san,&#8221;
said Apon&#299;bolinayen. Not long after they laid down their quids and they were rows of agate beads which have no holes. Algaba
said, &#8220;It is good for us to be married.&#8221; So they were married and they went to Dag&aacute;la. As soon as they arrived in Dag&aacute;la,
&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he said to his mother <i>alan</i>, &#8220;now we are going to take you to Kadalayapan, because I have found a wife.&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; said the <i>alan</i>, &#8220;we must first build <i>balaua</i> here.&#8221; &#8220;That is good if it is what you desire,&#8221; said Algaba.

</p>
<p id="d0e2320">Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen commanded people to pound rice, and others to get betel-nuts which were covered with gold. So
they truly made <i>Sayang.</i><a id="d0e2324src" href="#d0e2324" class="noteref">37</a> Not long after when it became evening they made <i>L&#299;bon.</i><a href="#d0e2324" class="noteref">37</a> &#8220;The best for us to do is to invite Apon&#299;balagen, and all the people of Kadalayapan and some other places,&#8221; said Algaba.
Not long after they sent the betel-nuts which were covered with gold to invite their relatives. Some of the betel-nuts they
sent to Kaodanan. &#8220;Sir, come to Dag&aacute;la, because Apon&#299;bolinayen and Algaba build <i>balaua</i>,&#8221; said the betel-nut to Apon&#299;balagen. When the other betel-nuts arrived at Kadalayapan to invite the people they said to
Langa-an, &#8220;Come to Dag&aacute;la because Apon&#299;bolinayen and Algaba make <i>balaua</i>.&#8221; Not long after Apon&#299;balagen and Apon&#299;gawan&#299; and the other people went.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2343"></a>Page 46</span></p>
<p id="d0e2344">When they reached the middle of the way they met the people of Kadalayapan, so they were a large party who went. When they
arrived at Dag&aacute;la, at the place where the spring is, they saw that all the stones by the river were gold and they were surprised,
and the people who were dipping water from the spring were there. &#8220;You people who are dipping water, where is the shallow
place for us to cross?&#8221; they said. &#8220;You look for the place where the people go across?&#8221; said the people who were dipping water.
Not long after they went across the river. As soon as they reached the other side of the river, they took a bath. The women
who were dipping water saw that the water which ran from their bodies were agates which had no holes. &#8220;How wonderful are the
people who live in Kadalayapan and Kaodanan, for they are relatives of Kabon&#299;yan<a id="d0e2346src" href="#d0e2346" class="noteref">38</a> and they have power,&#8221; said the women who were dipping water from the well.

</p>
<p id="d0e2349">&#8220;You people who are dipping water, where is the trail which leads to the house of Algaba of Dag&aacute;la?&#8221; they said. &#8220;Follow the
head poles; they are along the road to his house,&#8221; said the women who were dipping water. So they went up truly to the town,
and the boa constrictors which made the fence around the town did not move when they passed, for they were afraid, and when
they arrived at the house of Algaba the <i>alan</i> danced. When they sat down Pagatip&aacute;nan was in a hurry. &#8220;Ala! Langa-an, let us go and give the betel-nut which is covered
with gold to Algaba,&#8221; he said and they went truly. They told Algaba that they were going to chew betel-nut, because they wished
to learn if they were relatives; and Algaba said &#8220;That is good,&#8221; and they called Apon&#299;gawan&#299; to the house, and they cut the
betel-nut in pieces. As soon as they cut it in pieces, &#8220;The best way to do is for you to tell your name first, because we
came to visit you,&#8221; said Pagatip&aacute;nan to Algaba. &#8220;No, old man, you tell your name first,&#8221; said Algaba. Not long after, &#8220;My
name is Pagatip&aacute;nan who am the <i>Lakay</i><a id="d0e2356src" href="#d0e2356" class="noteref">39</a> of Kadalayapan.&#8221; Not long after, &#8220;My name is Pagbok&aacute;san who is the father of Apon&#299;balagen of Kaodanan.&#8221; Not long after, &#8220;My
name is Algaba who is the son of an <i>alan</i> who has deformed feet,<a id="d0e2362src" href="#d0e2362" class="noteref">40</a> who has no sister; we are not like you people who have power,&#8221; said Algaba. Not long after, &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;balagen of Kaodanan
who is the son of Ebang and Pagbok&aacute;san.&#8221; Not long after, &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;gawan&#299; of Kadalayapan who has no brother, so that
when some enemies come into our town I dress in the bark of trees.&#8221; Not long after, &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;bolinayen who is the
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2368"></a>Page 47</span>sister of Apon&#299;balagen.&#8221; As soon as they told their names, they laid down their betel-nut quids. The quids of Algaba and Apon&#299;gawan&#299;
both went to the quid of Pagatip&aacute;nan, also the quids of Apon&#299;balagen and Apon&#299;bolinayen went to the quid of Pagbok&aacute;san. Then
Apon&#299;gawan&#299; stood up. &#8220;You are so strange, Algaba, you are my brother. I am so glad that I have a brother now. You are bad
for you let the enemies come into Kadalayapan,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Excuse me for I was far from Kadalayapan and did not see; it is
our custom for some of us to go to fight,&#8221; said Algaba. &#8220;The best way to do, Apon&#299;tolau,<a id="d0e2370src" href="#d0e2370" class="noteref">41</a> is for you to go back with us to Kadalayapan,&#8221; said Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. &#8220;If that is what you wish it is all right,&#8221; he said. Not
long after the <i>balaua</i> was finished and they took them to Kadalayapan. The valuable things which the <i>alan</i> owned she gave to them, and she flew away.

</p>
<p id="d0e2379">When they arrived in Kadalayapan, Apon&#299;balagen wanted to marry Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. He sent his mother to go and give the message.
As soon as she arrived in Kadalayapan, &#8220;Good morning, nephew Apon&#299;tolau,&#8221; said Ebang. &#8220;Good morning, what are you here for?&#8221;
said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;What are you coming for, you say. Apon&#299;balagen sent me to talk to you, for he wishes to marry Apon&#299;gawan&#299;,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;If you think it is good it will be all right,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau, so she took out the engagement gift and she put
one earring inside of a little jar and it was filled with gold. Apon&#299;tolau lifted his eyebrows and half of the gold disappeared,
so Ebang put another earring in the pot and it was full again. &#8220;Ala! when it becomes evening you come and bring Apon&#299;balagen,&#8221;
he said to Ebang. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. So she went home. As soon as she arrived in their house in Kaodanan, Apon&#299;balagen asked
the result of her trip. &#8220;They agreed all right; we will go when it becomes evening,&#8221; said Ebang. When it became night they
went to Kadalayapan and he lived with Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. When it became morning he took Apon&#299;gawan&#299; to Kaodanan and the father and
mother of Apon&#299;gawan&#299; and the other people followed them. They went to get the marriage payment. It was the <i>balaua</i> filled nine times with jars. As soon as they gave all the payment, Apon&#299;tolau was the next to make his payment. It was also
the <i>balaua</i> filled nine times. As soon as they made all the payment they went home.

<p id="d0e2387">(Told by Mano, a woman of Patok.)

</p><a id="d0e2389"></a><h2>3</h2>
<p id="d0e2392">&#8220;I am going to wash my hair. Give me the rice straw, which has been inherited nine times,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau to his mother Langa-an.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2394"></a>Page 48</span>So Langa-an gave him some and he went to the river to wash. As soon as he arrived at the well he saw the pretty girl who was
washing her hair. He went and sat down on her skirt and the pretty girl told him not to cut her in many places so she would
not need to doctor the wounds. &#8220;If I were an old enemy I would have killed you at the first. It is bad for us to talk when
we do not know each other's names. Let us chew betel-nut,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;No, for it is not my custom,&#8221; said the girl.
But Apon&#299;tolau compelled her to chew betel-nut with him. &#8220;You tell your name first,&#8221; he said to her. &#8220;No, it is not good for
me to tell my name first, for I am a woman. You are a man. You tell your name first.&#8221; So Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;tolau
of Kadalayapan who am the son of Langa-an and Pagatip&aacute;nan, who came here to wash my hair. It is good fortune for me that I
met you here washing your hair.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Gimbangonan of Natpangan, who am the daughter of It-tonagan, who is the sister
of Aldasan.&#8221; As soon as she told her name she disappeared and went to hide among the betel nuts on the branch of a tree. So
Apon&#299;tolau was very sorry and he went back home without washing his hair. As soon as he arrived where Langa-an was sitting
he said to her &#8220;Mother, when I arrived at the well by the river I met a pretty girl whose name was Gimbangonan, the daughter
of It-tonagan of Natpangan. We chewed betel-nuts and told our names, but as soon as she told her name she disappeared and
I could not see her. She said that she lived in Natpangan. I want to marry her. Will you go and arrange the <i>pak&aacute;lon?&#8221;</i><a id="d0e2398src" href="#d0e2398" class="noteref">42</a> So Langa-an went at once and got her hat which was as large as the <i>salakasak</i><a id="d0e2406src" href="#d0e2406" class="noteref">43</a> for she saw that Apon&#299;tolau was sorrowful.

</p>
<p id="d0e2409">When she took her hat it clucked.<a id="d0e2411src" href="#d0e2411" class="noteref">44</a> &#8220;Why does my hat cluck when I take it down? I think they do not like you, Apon&#299;tolau,&#8221; said Langa-an. &#8220;No, you go and try.&#8221;
So Langa-an went again to get her hat and again it clucked, but nevertheless she took it and went. When she was in the middle
of the way the head of the hat which was like a bird swung and made Langa-an turn her head and it clucked again. Langa-an
sat down by the trail and wondered what would happen. Not long after she went on again and she met Asindam&aacute;yan near the ford.
She asked where the ford was and when Asindam&aacute;yan told her, she spread her belt on the water and it ferried her across. Not
long after she reached the other side of the river, and she inquired for the house of Gimbangonan. Asindam&aacute;yan answered, &#8220;You
look for the house where many people are putting props under the house. That is the house of Gimbangonan. Her porch has many
holes in it.&#8221;
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2417"></a>Page 49</span></p>
<p id="d0e2418">When Langa-an arrived at the house she said, &#8220;Good afternoon.&#8221; And It-tonagan and Gimbangonan answered, &#8220;Good afternoon.&#8221;
They invited her to go up into the house and she went. &#8220;Why do you come here, Aunt?&#8221; said Gimbangonan. &#8220;I came to arrange
for you to marry Apon&#299;tolau, for he wants to marry you and has sent me to talk about the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>.&#8221; Gimbangonan was very happy and said to her mother, &#8220;You tell him yes, for I wish to marry Apon&#299;tolau.&#8221; So It-tonagan agreed
to the marriage and Langa-an asked how much the marriage price would be. &#8220;The regular custom of the people with magical power
which is the <i>balaua</i> nine times full,&#8221; said Aldasan, because It-tonagan was always restless and was walking outside the house. So Langa-an left
a little jar and agate bead, as a sign of the engagement, for Gimbangonan. Not long after she went back home to Kadalayapan.
When she arrived where Apon&#299;tolau was lying down she said, &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Wes</span>&#8221; for she was tired and Apon&#299;tolau heard her and he went and inquired what was the matter. His mother answered that they had
agreed on the marriage and the next day he could go and marry Gimbangonan.

</p>
<p id="d0e2429">As soon as the next day came they prepared jars of <i>basi</i>,<a id="d0e2434src" href="#d0e2434" class="noteref">45</a> and pigs to be carried to Natpangan, and Apon&#299;tolau carried one large empty jar.<a id="d0e2437src" href="#d0e2437" class="noteref">46</a> So they went. As soon as they arrived Apon&#299;tolau asked where Gimbangonan was, and the people said, &#8220;Look at the big woman.&#8221;
He looked and saw that she was a very big woman and Apon&#299;tolau cried, for she was not the girl he had seen before, and he
bent his head. While the old men were talking to each other Gimbangonan said to Apon&#299;tolau, &#8220;Come here, Apon&#299;tolau. Be very
happy. Why do you bend your head?&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau did not listen, and he did not go. Not long after Langa-an and the others went
back home and left Apon&#299;tolau to be joined to Gimbangonan. Apon&#299;tolau was afraid to go to Gimbangonan, for she was a very
big woman. She called to him all the time, but he did not go to her. It-tonagan was restless and did not stay in the house
even in the night, and they could not sleep.

</p>
<p id="d0e2440">After ten days Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;I am going to Kadalayapan for a little while. I will return soon.&#8221; &#8220;If you go to Kadalayapan
I will go with you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do not go this time and I will take you next time,&#8221; he said, and he went. When he was near
the gate of the town of Kadalayapan he hung his head until he reached his house. His mother asked why he hung his head. &#8220;I
do not wish to marry Gimbangonan for she is not the woman I met by the river.&#8221; &#8220;Do not be angry with me for I did what you
wished. I would not have engaged you to Gimbangonan <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2442"></a>Page 50</span>if you had not sent me.&#8221; They sent their <i>liblibayan</i><a id="d0e2446src" href="#d0e2446" class="noteref">47</a> to go and get betel-nuts which were covered with gold, for they intended to make <i>Sayang</i>, so that they could find out who the woman was who had been by the river. Soon the <i>liblibayan</i> returned and they said, &#8220;We did not get the betel-nuts which you desired for we found a pretty toy among the branches of
the tree.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau took the branch of the tree which shone as if covered with fire and he put a blanket on it and many
pillows around it. As soon as they had again commanded the <i>liblibayan</i> to get the betel-nuts they went and soon they arrived with the fruit. They oiled the betel-nuts and sent them to every place
in the world and if anyone refused to come they were to grow on their knees. Not long after the betel-nuts went to the different
towns and invited all the people.

</p>
<p id="d0e2458">When they arrived they danced and Apon&#299;tolau looked at them to see if the woman he met at the river was there, but she was
not among them, and he wondered what had become of the woman, for the betel-nuts had gone to all parts of the world. Apon&#299;tolau
went into the house for he was sorrowful, and he laid down near the blankets and he noticed that the blankets appeared as
if on fire and he was frightened.<a id="d0e2460src" href="#d0e2460" class="noteref">48</a> He got up and unwrapped the blankets and he saw a pretty girl. &#8220;I did not think you were here. I have been engaged. You said
your name was Gimbangonan, and I sent my mother to engage me to you, but when I saw Gimbangonan she was a big woman so I left
her and came here to make <i>balaua</i> so I might find you. You cannot escape from me now for I shall hold your hand. Let us chew betel-nut.&#8221; So they chewed and
Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;tolau of Kadalayapan who is the son of Langa-an and Pagbok&aacute;san to whom you told a lie for
you said you were Gimbangonan, and now I want to know your real name.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;bolinayen of Natpangan who is the
daughter of Ebang and Pagatip&aacute;nan.&#8221; When they had told their names they saw that they were related and that they both possessed
magical power, so they were married.

</p>
<p id="d0e2469">After three days, Apon&#299;tolau said to Apon&#299;bolinayen, &#8220;Wait for me in the house. Do not be lonesome, for our mother is here.
I am going to see my pasture.&#8221; &#8220;Do not stay long,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;If anyone comes you hide in the house,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau.
Not long after he went and when he arrived in the pasture all the jars went around him and all the jars stuck out their tongues
for they were very hungry for they had not been fed for a long time. The jars were <i>somadag, ginlasan, malayo</i>, and <i>tadogan</i>, and other kinds also.<a id="d0e2477src" href="#d0e2477" class="noteref">49</a> When Apon&#299;tolau thought <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2483"></a>Page 51</span>that all the jars had arrived where he was he fed them with betel-nut, first covered with <i>lawed</i><a id="d0e2487src" href="#d0e2487" class="noteref">50</a> leaves. As soon as he had fed them he gave them some salt. Not long after he went back home and he rode on a carabao.

</p>
<p id="d0e2492">When he arrived at their house he called to Apon&#299;bolinayen, but no one answered him and he was surprised. So he hurried to
the house and he saw that Apon&#299;bolinayen was dead and he was grieved. He took her in his lap and while her body was in his
lap it began to sweat. He used his power so that when he whipped<a id="d0e2494src" href="#d0e2494" class="noteref">51</a> his perfume <i>banaw&#7431;s</i> she said, &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Wes</span>.&#8221; When he whipped his perfume <i>dag&#299;monau</i> she awoke. When he whipped his perfume <i>al&#299;kadakad</i> she stood up and said, &#8220;I told you not to go, Apon&#299;tolau, but you went anyway. A big woman came here and stole all my things
and killed me. I don't know who she was.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau called his mother and asked who it was and his mother replied that it
was Gimbangonan. So Apon&#299;tolau went to Natpangan. &#8220;Why did you go to kill Apon&#299;bolinayen?&#8221; &#8220;I went to kill her for you do
not care for me any more.&#8221; &#8220;I do not like you, for you are a very big woman. Every time you step the floor is broken. If you
come again to Kadalayapan I will cut your head off. Do not come again to harm Apon&#299;bolinayen.&#8221; He went home to Kadalayapan
and he divorced Gimbangonan.

</p>
<p id="d0e2512">Not long after they went to the pasture and they rode on the back of a carabao. As soon as they arrived, all the jars rolled
around them and stuck out their tongues and Apon&#299;bolinayen was afraid, for she feared the jars would eat them. The wide field
was full of jars. Apon&#299;tolau gave them betel-nut and <i>lawed</i> vine and salt. As soon as they fed them they went back home. Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen said to Apon&#299;tolau, &#8220;We are going
to Natpangan to visit my father and mother,&#8221; so they went. As soon as they arrived there Apon&#299;bolinayen told her father and
mother that Apon&#299;tolau had a pasture filled with many different kinds of jars, in the place of Kabinalan. When they had been
in Natpangan ten days they returned home and Apon&#299;bolinayen's father and mother went with them and saw the jars. When they
reached the field where the jars were they were afraid that the jars would eat them, but Apon&#299;tolau fed them. The father and
mother of Apon&#299;bolinayen were surprised for there were many valuable jars which filled the wide field of Kabinalan. Not long
after they went back home to Natpangan.

</p><a id="d0e2521"></a><h2>4</h2>
<p id="d0e2524">&#8220;Sinogyaman, come and oil my hair so that I can go to war,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;And you, Sinagayan, put some rice in the pot
and cook it, and also some fish for us to eat.&#8221; Not long after she cooked, and Sinogyaman oiled his hair. When Sinagayan finished
cooking they ate and started to go to G&#7431;g&#7431;nawan where As&#299;bowan lived. Sinogyaman and Sinagayan did not want him to go, but
Apon&#299;tolau went anyway.

</p>
<p id="d0e2526">When he arrived at the edge of the town he stood still a long time, for he did not know the way to G&#7431;g&#7431;nawan. A bird went
to him and said, &#8220;Why do you stand here for a long time, Apon&#299;tolau?&#8221; &#8220;Why do you stand a long time, you say, and I am going
to the town of As&#299;bowan, whom every one says is a pretty girl,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau to the bird. &#8220;Ala, Apon&#299;tolau, it is best
for you to follow me and I will show you the way to the place where As&#299;bowan lives.&#8221; Not long after they went and they soon
arrived at the town of G&#7431;g&#7431;nawan. &#8220;Ala, Apon&#299;tolau, I leave you now for I have showed you the way,&#8221; said the bird. So Apon&#299;tolau
went alone to the house of As&#299;bowan. When he reached the ladder of her house As&#299;bowan was looking out of the window and she
said, &#8220;Oh, there is a rich gentleman. How are you? Where are you going?&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;I am going to Nagsingkawan, but
I have lost my way and I thought that this was Nagsingkawan. I saw this house so I came to get a drink.&#8221; &#8220;This is not Nagsingkawan.
Come up and I will cook and we will eat.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau went up into the house and the girl gave him water to drink. She cooked
and then she called him. &#8220;I do not want to eat yet. I will rest for awhile and eat when your husband comes,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau.


</p>
<p id="d0e2528">Not long after, while they were talking he saw As&#299;bowan break the fish stick and put it in the pot and he watched to see what
would become of the stick. He saw that it became a fish.<a id="d0e2530src" href="#d0e2530" class="noteref">52</a> She called often for Apon&#299;tolau to come and eat and he went and he said, &#8220;I want to wait until your husband comes, for it
is not good for us to eat first, and it is not good for us to be eating when he arrives.&#8221; &#8220;Come, it will be all right. We
will eat now, and he can eat when he comes&#8221; said As&#299;bowan. So he went to eat with her, for he was very hungry. He saw that
she took all the rice and fish out of the pots, and there were only dishes for them. &#8220;What is the matter with this woman that
she does not leave any fish for her husband?&#8221; he said to himself. While they were eating As&#299;bowan told him that she did not
have a husband and Apon&#299;tolau smiled. When they finished eating, they cut betel-nut for <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2536"></a>Page 53</span>them to chew. &#8220;Now be patient for we must chew betel-nut, for it is not good for us to talk until we know each other's names.&#8221;
As&#299;bowan said, &#8220;How can we chew betel-nut, for I do not chew for I am related to Kabon&#299;yan?&#8221;<a id="d0e2538src" href="#d0e2538" class="noteref">53</a> &#8220;You must chew anyway for we cannot tell our names unless we chew,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. When Apon&#299;tolau urged her a long time
she took the betel-nut and they chewed. &#8220;Since you are the lady who lives here, it is best that you tell your name first,&#8221;
said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;No it is not good for a woman to tell her name first, so you must tell your name,&#8221; said As&#299;bowan. Not long
after, &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;tolau of Kadalayapan who is the son of Langa-an and Pagatip&aacute;nan, who goes to find a pretty girl who
has power like me,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;My name is As&#299;bowan of G&#7431;g&#7431;nawan, who lives alone in the field, who has no neighbors
for this is my fortune,&#8221; said As&#299;bowan. So Apon&#299;tolau staid with her nine months and his father and mother were searching
for him. They had many people searching for him and they killed many animals to feed the people until all their animals were
gone. The bones which they threw away made a pile nine times as large as the <i>balaua</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e2544">As&#299;bowan became pregnant and not long after she gave birth. &#8220;What shall we call our girl?&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;We will call
her Binaklingan.&#8221; When As&#299;bowan bathed the baby it grew one span for she used magical power. So the baby grew one span every
time.<a id="d0e2546src" href="#d0e2546" class="noteref">54</a> Not long after she could walk, Apon&#299;tolau saw the pile of bones which the searchers had thrown away when they ate, and it
was nine times larger than the <i>balaua</i>. &#8220;The best thing for us to do, As&#299;bowan, is for us to go to Kadalayapan, for my father and mother are still searching for
me and the people who are searching are eating all their animals.&#8221; &#8220;The best thing for you to do is to go home and find a
woman whom you should marry and then when you are married you make <i>Sayang</i><a id="d0e2557src" href="#d0e2557" class="noteref">55</a> and I will come to Kadalayapan,&#8221; said As&#299;bowan, for it was not good for them to be married because she had less magical power
than Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;If you do not wish to go, I will take our daughter Binaklingan.&#8221; &#8220;Wait awhile until we have commanded that
a house be built for her to live in.&#8221; Not long after they commanded that a house be made for Binaklingan, and it was all of
gold. It was finished in the middle of the night and she used magic so that the golden house went to Kadalayapan.

</p>
<p id="d0e2563">When Apon&#299;tolau woke up early in the early morning he heard many roosters crowing and many people talking. &#8220;My daughter Binaklingan,
how bad your mother is, for she sent us here to Kadalayapan without <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2565"></a>Page 54</span>telling us,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. His daughter was very sorry but she played on the pan pipe. When it was morning Langa-an saw
the golden house by their house. &#8220;Why there is a different house here. I think Apon&#299;tolau has arrived and maybe he is in that
house,&#8221; said Langa-an to Pagbok&aacute;san,<a id="d0e2567src" href="#d0e2567" class="noteref">56</a> and Pagbok&aacute;san went outdoors. &#8220;Are you here Apon&#299;tolau? We had sought you for a long time, but did not find you. None of
our animals are left alive,&#8221; said Pagbok&aacute;san. &#8220;Why did you search for me? I told Sinogyaman and Sinagayan that I was going
to fight. Did they not tell you?&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;We thought that you encountered our old, dangerous enemies, for you have
been away many months. Why do you have a daughter who is a young girl?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, Binaklingan who is here is my daughter, and
her mother As&#299;bowan with whom I lived for a long time did not want to come here to Kadalyapan, for she said I must find a
girl suitable for me to marry and then we must make <i>balaua</i> so that she will come to our town.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e2576">When they had been in Kadalayapan five days, they went to take a walk in the evening of the sixth day, and they went to the
spring of Lisn&aacute;yan. As soon as he arrived at the spring he used magic so that all the pretty girls who never go outdoors felt
hot and went to the spring to bathe.<a id="d0e2578src" href="#d0e2578" class="noteref">57</a> Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen felt very hot and she went to take a bath at the spring. Apon&#299;tolau saw her taking a bath and
she looked like the half of a rainbow, and Apon&#299;tolau went to her, and Apon&#299;bolinayen saw him while she was bathing. &#8220;Do not
wound me in more than one place so I will not have so much to cure.&#8221; &#8220;If I was an enemy I would have killed you at once,&#8221;
said Apon&#299;tolau. Soon he cut a betel-nut into two pieces. &#8220;It is best for us to chew betel-nut for it is bad for us to talk
when we do not know each other's names.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen did not wish to chew, but when Apon&#299;tolau urged her she chewed and
they told their names. &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;tolau of Kadalayapan who is the son of Pagbok&aacute;san and Langa-an.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;bolinayen
of Kaodanan who is the sister of Apon&#299;balagen who put me at the place close to the spring of Lisn&aacute;yan, for he does not wish
anyone to see me, but you have found me.&#8221; Not long after, while they were talking, Apon&#299;bolinayen used magic so that she vanished and she went among the betel-nuts
on the branch of the tree. &#8220;Where did the girl go? I did not see her when she vanished,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau to himself. Not long
after he went home with his head <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2587"></a>Page 55</span>bent for he was very sorrowful. When he arrived at their house, &#8220;Why are you bending your head Apon&#299;tolau?&#8221; said his mother.
&#8220;What are you bending your head for? you say, and I went to the well of Lisn&aacute;yan and talked with Apon&#299;bolinayen, but after
a while she vanished and I could not see her anymore.&#8221; &#8220;Did you not give her any betel-nut?&#8221; asked his mother. &#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221;
&#8220;What are you so sorry for if you gave her betel-nut? you will find her bye and bye,&#8221; said his mother.

</p>
<p id="d0e2589">On the second night he went again to Lisn&aacute;yan and he used his power so that all the young girls, were hot again so that they
went to the spring. When he looked up where there were many betel-nuts he saw Apon&#299;bolinayen taking a bath. &#8220;I did not see
you when you left me Apon&#299;bolinayen,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;Now I am going to take you home.&#8221; &#8220;No, do not take me for my brother
will hate me. I do not want to go to your house.&#8221; He took her to his town of Kadalayapan and he sent his mother to Natpangan
to tell Apon&#299;balagen that Apon&#299;bolinayen was in Kadalayapan. Not long after his mother Langa-an took her skirt and her hat
which was like a bird and when she arrived at the gate of Kaodanan Sinogyaman was dipping water from the spring. &#8220;Niece Sinogyaman,
where is the ford?&#8221; &#8220;Look there at the shallow place, for it is the ford.&#8221; She took off her belt and she spread it on the
water, and she rode on it to the other side, and then she took a bath. When she finished bathing she stood on a high stone
and the drops of water from her body were agate beads with no holes. &#8220;How strange, the people of Kadalayapan are. They are
very different from us,&#8221; said the women who were dipping water from the spring. Not long after Langa-an put on her skirt,
and when she finished she said, &#8220;Are you not finished dipping water, Sinogyaman? I want you to guide me to the house of my
nephew Apon&#299;balagen, for I have forgotten the way, for I have not been here for a long time.&#8221; &#8220;No, I am not through, but I
will show you the way, Aunt,&#8221; said Sinogyaman, and she guided her.

</p>
<p id="d0e2594">When they reached the yard of Apon&#299;balagen, &#8220;Good morning, Nephew.&#8221; &#8220;Good morning, Aunt,&#8221; he said to her. &#8220;Come up.&#8221; Not long
after she went up the stairs. &#8220;What are you coming here for, Aunt?&#8221; &#8220;What are you coming here for? you say. I come because
I wish to see you.&#8221; Not long after he went to get <i>basi</i>, and he had made her drink. When they had drunk, she said, &#8220;The other reason I came here, Nephew Apon&#299;balagen, is that Apon&#299;tolau
sent me, for he wishes to marry your sister.&#8221; &#8220;I have no sister. I do not know what my mother did with her,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;We
have no daughter. Apon&#299;balagen is our only child,&#8221; said Ebang. While they were still talking they kept on drinking the <i>basi</i>. When the old woman Langa-an became drunk she told them that Apon&#299;bolinayen was <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2602"></a>Page 56</span>in Kadalayapan, and Apon&#299;balagen was surprised and his heart jumped. &#8220;I went to hide Apon&#299;bolinayen in Lisn&aacute;yan so that no
one would see her, but now someone has found her.&#8221; So Langa-an gave them the engagement present<a id="d0e2604src" href="#d0e2604" class="noteref">58</a> and she asked how much they must pay as the marriage price. &#8220;You must fill the <i>balaua</i> nine times,&#8221; they answered. So Langa-an filled the <i>balaua</i> nine times with different kinds of valuable things. As soon as she had paid the marriage price she went back home. When she
arrived in Kadalayapan and reached the top of the ladder of the house she laid down and slept, for she was drunk. &#8220;How strange
you act, mother. Why don't you tell us the news before you sleep?&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau, and she said, &#8220;The engagement and marriage
gifts were accepted.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e2616">In the afternoon they began to make <i>Sayang</i>.<a id="d0e2621src" href="#d0e2621" class="noteref">59</a> Not long after the old woman Alokot&aacute;n, who conducted the <i>Sayang</i> and made them dance <i>Da-eng</i>,<a id="d0e2633src" href="#d0e2633" class="noteref">60</a> arrived and she began to perform the ceremony. When it became morning, &#8220;You people who live with us, come and pound rice,&#8221;
said Apon&#299;bolinayen. So the people gathered and pounded rice for them. As soon as they finished pounding rice she commanded
her <i>liblibayan</i><a id="d0e2641src" href="#d0e2641" class="noteref">61</a> to go and get betel-nuts. When they arrived with the betel-nuts, &#8220;You betel-nuts come and oil yourselves and go to invite
all our relatives, for we are making <i>Sayang</i>. Invite all the people except the old enemies,&#8221; she said and when it became evening they made <i>L&#299;bon</i><a id="d0e2652src" href="#d0e2652" class="noteref">62</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e2658">As&#299;bowan was anxious to chew betel-nut and she went to search for one in the corner of her house and she found an oiled nut
which was covered with gold. When she tried to cut it in two it said to her. &#8220;Do not cut me, for I came to invite people to
attend the <i>Sayang</i> of Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen.&#8221; And As&#299;bowan said, &#8220;I cannot go.&#8221; &#8220;If you do not come I will grow on your knee,&#8221; said
the betel-nut. &#8220;No, go on my big pig.&#8221; So the betel-nut jumped on the head of her pig and it grew very high, and the pig squealed.
&#8220;Get off from my pig and I will come,&#8221; said As&#299;bowan. Late in the afternoon they saw her below the <i>talagan</i>.<a id="d0e2666src" href="#d0e2666" class="noteref">63</a> &#8220;As&#299;bowan is here now, Apon&#299;bolinayen, come and see her,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. So Apon&#299;bolinayen came and she took her to their
house, and Iwaginan took two skirts and he made them dance. He danced first with As&#299;bowan before he made the others dance
and his wife <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2672"></a>Page 57</span>Gimbagonan was jealous. When they finished dancing he gave the skirts to Apon&#299;balagen and Sinagayan. As soon as Apon&#299;balagen
had finished Iwaginan made Apon&#299;tolau dance with Gimbagonan. While they were dancing Gimbagonan danced to the sound of the
jars which she had about her neck and in her hair, i.e., she had necklaces of big jars and they stuck together so she could
not hear the <i>gansas</i>. Not long after As&#299;bowan wished to go back home. &#8220;Now I am going home, Apon&#299;bolinayen, for no one is watching my house,&#8221;
&#8220;No, do not go yet, for someone wants to marry your daughter Binaklingan.&#8221; &#8220;I must go now, you take care of her.&#8221; So she went
back home and they did not see her. As soon as the <i>Sayang</i> was over Dina-ogan was engaged to Binaklingan. Soon he paid the marriage price, and it was the <i>balaua</i> filled nine times with valuable things.

</p>
<p id="d0e2683">Not long after all the people went back to their homes, and Apon&#299;balagen was left alone and he acted as if he was drunk, but
he was not drunk. He laid down in the <i>balaua</i>, and Apon&#299;bolinayen covered him with blankets. Not long after Apon&#299;gawan&#299; went outdoors for she felt hot, and Apon&#299;balagen
peeped at her. Not long after she went inside of the house and went into the ninth room, and Apon&#299;balagen watched her. When
it became night Apon&#299;balagen went to the place where she was and Apon&#299;tolau did not see him. So he looked for her in the ninth
room, and she was playing the pan pipe. While she was playing she saw a firefly, and she tried to hit it with her pan pipe,
and Apon&#299;balagen said &#8220;Do not strike me or you will hit my headaxe,&#8221; and he became a man again. &#8220;How did you get in here?&#8221; said Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. &#8220;I came, because I saw you when I was lying in the <i>balaua</i>.&#8221; He sat down beside her and tried to cut a betel-nut for her to chew. &#8220;We will chew betel-nut so we can tell our names,&#8221; said
Apon&#299;balagen. She took the betel-nut and they chewed. &#8220;You tell your name first, for you live here.&#8221; &#8220;No it is not good for
me to tell my name first, for I am a woman. You are the first.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;balagen who is the brother of Apon&#299;bolinayen
who is the son of Pagbok&aacute;san of Kaodanan.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;gawan&#299; who is the sister of Apon&#299;tolau who is the daughter of
Pagatip&aacute;nan and Langa-an.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e2699">When they had been in the room nine nights Apon&#299;tolau went to see Apon&#299;gawan&#299;, and when he got to the room Apon&#299;balagen was
there. &#8220;Why are you here, brother-in-law?&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;I am here, because I wish to marry your sister,&#8221; said Apon&#299;balagen.
&#8220;If you want to marry her you must engage her and you come another day to make <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>.&#8221;<a id="d0e2706src" href="#d0e2706" class="noteref">64</a> Not long after Apon&#299;balagen went <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2712"></a>Page 58</span>home and told his father and mother that they would go next day to make the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> so he could marry Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. Apon&#299;tolau and his father and mother went to Kaodanan and took the marriage price before Apon&#299;balagen
and his people made the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>. Apon&#299;balagen paid the same as Apon&#299;tolau did for Apon&#299;bolinayen. Not long after they returned to Kadalayapan and the next
day Apon&#299;balagen went and got Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. They danced for one month and then they took Apon&#299;gawan&#299; to Kaodanan, and all the
people went home. This is all.

<p id="d0e2720">(Told by Lagmani, a woman of Patok.)

</p><a id="d0e2722"></a><h2>5</h2>
<p id="d0e2725">&#8220;Mother Dinaw&aacute;gan go and engage me to someone, for I want to be married. I like the sister of Apon&#299;balagen of Natpangan&#8221; said
Gawigawen of Adasin. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his mother. So she took her hat which looked like the moonbeam and she started to go and
when she arrived in Natpangan she said, &#8220;Good morning, nephew Apon&#299;balagen.&#8221; &#8220;What do you want here, Aunt?&#8221; he replied. &#8220;What
do you want, you say, and I want to talk with you.&#8221; &#8220;Come up, Aunt, and we will hear what you have to say.&#8221; So he asked his
mother Ebang to prepare food. As soon as Ebang had prepared the food and called them to eat, Apon&#299;balagen went to get the
<i>basi</i> and they drank before they ate. And Ebang broke up the fish stick and put it in the pot and it became fish.<a id="d0e2732src" href="#d0e2732" class="noteref">65</a> Not long after they ate, and when they had finished Apon&#299;balagen said to Dinaw&aacute;gan, &#8220;Come and see this.&#8221; &#8220;No, I better stay
here.&#8221; When Apon&#299;balagen urged her she came in and he opened the <i>bas&#299;</i> jar which was nine times inherited and as soon as they had drank Dinaw&aacute;gan said that she could not tarry for it was afternoon,
&#8220;I have something to tell you, Apon&#299;balagen.&#8221; &#8220;What is it?&#8221; said Apon&#299;balagen. &#8220;My son Gawigawen of Adasin wants to marry
your sister.&#8221; Apon&#299;balagen agreed, so she gave a golden cup which looked like the moon as an engagement present, and they
agreed on a day for <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>.<a id="d0e2744src" href="#d0e2744" class="noteref">66</a> Apon&#299;balagen said, &#8220;Tomorrow will be the day for <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e2753">Dinaw&aacute;gan went home. &#8220;Did they accept our golden cup which looks like the moon, mother?&#8221; asked Gawigawen. &#8220;Yes. Tomorrow will
be the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>,&#8221; said the mother. Not long after she said, &#8220;All you people who live in the same town with us, prepare to go to the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> of Gawigawen in Natpangan tomorrow afternoon.&#8221; The people agreed and in the morning they truly started and they went. &#8220;You,
my <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2763"></a>Page 59</span>jar <i>bilibili</i> which always salutes the visitors, go first; and you my jar <i>ginlasan</i> follow, and you <i>malayo</i> and <i>tadogan</i> and you <i>gumtan</i>.&#8221;<a id="d0e2780src" href="#d0e2780" class="noteref">67</a> So they went first to Natpangan, and Gawigawen and the people followed them, and also eighteen young girls who were Gawigawen's
concubines went also.

</p>
<p id="d0e2783">Not long after they arrived in Natpangan and Iwaginan and the other people went to attend the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>, and also many people from the other towns. When all whom they had invited arrived they agreed how much Gawigawen should
pay for his wife. Apon&#299;balagen told them to fill the <i>balaua</i><a id="d0e2790src" href="#d0e2790" class="noteref">68</a> eighteen times with valuable things. So the <i>balaua</i> was filled. Not long after they ate and when they had finished they went to the yard and they played on <i>gansas</i> and danced. Iwaginan took the skirts and gave one to Nagten-nga&#7431;yan of Kapan&#299;k&#299;yan and they danced.<a id="d0e2802src" href="#d0e2802" class="noteref">69</a> When she danced she looked like the spindle. She did not go around, but always moving and the water from the river went up
into the town and the striped fishes bit her heels. Not long after they stopped dancing and Gimbagonan was jealous and she
said &#8220;Ala, give me the skirt and I will dance next.&#8221; &#8220;Do not say that Gimbagonan, for it is shameful for us,&#8221; he answered
her. Not long after he gave the cloth to Dakandokan of Pakapsowan. She danced with Algaba of Dagala. Not long after they finished
dancing and Iwaginan made Apon&#299;bolinayen and Balogaygayan dance. He often went to fight in the enemies towns. Not long after
Apon&#299;bolinayen went down from the house and the sunshine vanished when she appeared. She danced with Balogaygayan and when
she moved her feet the water from the river went up again into the town and the fish bit at her heels as they did before.
After they stopped Iwag&#299;nan made his wife Gimbagonan dance and she was happy when she danced with Apon&#299;balagen. When they
danced the big jars around Gimbagonan's neck made more noise than the <i>gansas</i> and the jars said &#8220;K&#299;tol, k&#299;tol, kan&#299;tol, inka, inka, inkantol.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e2814">As soon as they finished dancing the people said, &#8220;The best thing to do is to go home, for we have been here three months
now.&#8221; &#8220;We will take Apon&#299;bolinayen&#8221; said Dinaw&aacute;gan to the people who lived in the same town with her and she spoke to Apon&#299;balagen.
So they prepared rice and coconut soaked together and wrapped in leaves, and a cake made of rice flour and coconut shaped
like a tongue, a rice cake, which was fried for Apon&#299;bolinayen's provision on the road. &#8220;You who live in the other towns who
were invited, do not go home yet for we are going <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2816"></a>Page 60</span>to take Apon&#299;bolinayen to Adasin,&#8221; said Apon&#299;balagen. Soon it became morning and they all went to Adasin and Gimbagonan carried
two big baskets of cakes, and while they were walking she ate all the time and she ate half of them. When they arrived at
the spring of Gawigawen of Adasin, they were surprised, for it was very beautiful and its sands were of beads, and the grass
they used to clean pots with was also beads and the place where the jars sat was a big dish.<a id="d0e2818src" href="#d0e2818" class="noteref">70</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e2824">&#8220;Go and tell Gawigawen that he must come here and bring an old man, for I am going to take his head and make a spring for Apon&#299;bolinayen,&#8221;
said Apon&#299;balagen. So someone went and told Gawigawen to bring the old man Ta&#333;dan with him to the spring. So Apon&#299;balagen
cut off his head and he made a spring and the water from it bubbled up and the body became a big tree called Alang&#299;gan<a id="d0e2828src" href="#d0e2828" class="noteref">71</a> which used to shade Apon&#299;bolinayen when she went to the spring to dip water, and the blood of the old man was changed to
valuable beads. Not long after they went up to the town and the place where they walked&#8212;from the spring to the ladder of the
house&#8212;was all big plates. Gimbagonan sat below the house ladder, because they were afraid the house could not hold her, for
she was a big woman, and she hated them and she said to Iwaginan, &#8220;Why do you put me here?&#8221; &#8220;We put you there because we are
afraid that you will break the house and give a bad sign to the boy and girl who are to be married.&#8221;<a id="d0e2833src" href="#d0e2833" class="noteref">72</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e2836">Apon&#299;bolinayen covered her face all of the time and she sat down in the middle of the house, for Indi&aacute;pan said that she must
not uncover her face for her husband Gawigawen had three noses, and she was afraid to look at him.<a id="d0e2838src" href="#d0e2838" class="noteref">73</a> But Gawigawen was a handsome man. Apon&#299;bolinayen believed what Indi&aacute;pan had told her. Not long after Dinaw&aacute;gan spread the
string of agate beads along the floor where Apon&#299;bolinayen sat.<a id="d0e2844src" href="#d0e2844" class="noteref">74</a> After a month they were still there and the people from the other towns wished to go home, and Apon&#299;balagen said to Apon&#299;bolinayen,
&#8220;Ala, be good to your husband and uncover your face. We are going back home now.&#8221; But Apon&#299;bolinayen would not uncover her
face. Not long after all the people went back to their towns and Apon&#299;bolinayen's mother-in-law commanded her to go and cook.
She did not uncover her face, but always felt when she went about, and when she had cooked, she refused to eat, but Gaw&#299;gawen and his father <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2856"></a>Page 61</span>and mother ate. When Gawigawen went to Apon&#299;bolinayen at night she changed to oil, and she did that every night, and they
put the carabao hides under her mat so the oil would not drop to the ground. On the fifth night she used magic so that they
could not see her go out and she dropped her beads under the house and then she became oil and dropped her body. So she went
away and always walked and Gawigawen looked for her, for a long time. He went to Natpangan for he could not find her in any
of the towns.

</p>
<p id="d0e2858">When Apon&#299;bolinayen was in the middle of the jungle she met a wild rooster which was crowing. &#8220;Where are you going Apon&#299;bolinayen?&#8221;
it said to her. &#8220;Why are you walking in the middle of the jungle?&#8221; and Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;I came here for I am running
away from my husband for I do not want to be married to him for he has three noses.&#8221; &#8220;No, Gawigawen is a handsome man. I often
see him, for this is where he comes often to snare chickens. Do not believe what Indi&aacute;pan said to you, for she is crazy,&#8221;
said the rooster. Not long after she walked on and she reached the place of many big trees and the big monkey met her and
said, &#8220;Where are you going, Apon&#299;bolinayen?&#8221; And she answered, &#8220;Where are you going, you say. I am running away because I
do not want to marry Gawigawen.&#8221; &#8220;Why don't you wish to marry Gawigawen?&#8221; &#8220;Because Indi&aacute;pan told me he has three noses.&#8221; The
monkey laughed and said, &#8220;Do not believe that. Indi&aacute;pan wants to marry Gawigawen herself. He is a handsome man.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen
walked on and soon she reached a wide field and she did not know where she was. She stopped in the middle of the field and
she thought she would go on to the other side.

</p>
<p id="d0e2860">Not long after she reached the ocean and she sat down on a log and a carabao came along. It passed often where she sat. Apon&#299;bolinayen
thought she would ride on the carabao, and she got on its back and it took her to the other side of the ocean. When they reached
the other side Apon&#299;bolinayen saw a big orange tree with much fruit on it. The carabao said, &#8220;Wait here while I eat grass
and I will return soon.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; but the carabao went to the place of the man who owned him and said,
&#8220;Come over here, for there is a good toy for you.&#8221; And Kadayadawan of Pintagayan said, &#8220;What is it?&#8221; &#8220;Come, hurry,&#8221; said the
carabao. So he combed his hair and oiled it and put on his striped coat and his clout and belt, and he took his spear and
he rode on the carabao's back. Not long after Kadayadawan saw the pretty girl in the orange tree and he said, &#8220;How pretty
she is!&#8221; And the carabao said, &#8220;That is the toy I told you about.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e2862">When they reached the orange tree Apon&#299;bolinayen heard him when he stuck his spear in the ground and she looked down and saw
a handsome <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2864"></a>Page 62</span>man. &#8220;Good morning, lady,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; answered Apon&#299;bolinayen. Not long after they chewed betel-nut and they
told their names. &#8220;My name is Kadayadawan of Pintagayan who is the son of an <i>alan</i>.&#8221;<a id="d0e2869src" href="#d0e2869" class="noteref">75</a> &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;bolinayen of Natpangan, who is the daughter of Pagbok&aacute;san and Ebang, who is the sister of Apon&#299;balagen.&#8221;
Their betel-nut quids became agate beads and Kadayadawan said to her, &#8220;Ala, it is good for us to marry. I am going to take
you home.&#8221; So he took her to his home and he was good to his carabao, because it had found him a pretty woman. When they reached
the house he put her in a room, and the <i>Ati</i><a id="d0e2874src" href="#d0e2874" class="noteref">76</a> commanded the soldiers to call Kadayadawan. When they reached the yard of Kadayadawan's house they called &#8220;Good morning.&#8221;
And he looked out of the window and said, &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; &#8220;We came, because the king wants you and we came to get you.&#8221;
So they started and went. When they arrived where the king was, &#8220;Why Kadayadawan have you a pretty girl in your house? Every
night I notice that your house appears as if it were burning.&#8221; &#8220;No, I have not,&#8221; answered Kadayadawan. &#8220;I think you have,
for I notice the flames every night.&#8221; &#8220;No, I have not. Where would I find a pretty woman?&#8221;<a id="d0e2877src" href="#d0e2877" class="noteref">77</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e2883">Not long after he went back home. When he reached home Apon&#299;bolinayen said to him, &#8220;It is best for us to make <i>Sayang</i>.&#8221;<a id="d0e2888src" href="#d0e2888" class="noteref">78</a> And Kadayadawan asked, &#8220;How do we make <i>Sayang</i> by ourselves? Our neighbors are all soldiers.&#8221; &#8220;Do not worry about that, I will see,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. Not long after
Kadayadawan took the betel-nuts and they oiled them and they sent them to the towns of their relatives to invite them to their
<i>balaua</i>. The betel-nuts went. Apon&#299;bolinayen told Kadayadawan to go and get <i>molave</i> sticks. When he arrived with them Apon&#299;bolinayen used magic and she said, &#8220;I use magic so that when I thrust the <i>molave</i> stick in the ground it will become a <i>balaua</i>.&#8221; Not long after the stick became a <i>balaua</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e2912">The betel-nuts arrived in Natpangan and said to Apon&#299;balagen, &#8220;We came to call you, for Kadayadawan of Pintagayan is making
<i>balaua</i>.&#8221; Apon&#299;balagen said, &#8220;How can we attend the <i>balaua</i> when we are searching for my sister?&#8221; &#8220;If you do not wish to come I will grow on your knee.&#8221; &#8220;Go on my pig.&#8221; So the betel-nut
grew on the pig, and it was so high the pig could not carry it and it squealed very much. &#8220;Ala, get off from the pig and we
will come.&#8221; So <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2920"></a>Page 63</span>the betel-nut got off and they started. &#8220;All you people who live in the same town come with me to attend the <i>balaua</i> of Kadayadawan of Pintagayan.&#8221; So they went. They arrived at the same time as Gawigawen of Adasin and they met near to the
river. Not long after Kadayadawan saw them by the river and he sent the betel-nuts to carry the people across the river. When
they were in the middle of the river Kadayadawan used his power so that their old clothes, which they wore in mourning for
Apon&#299;bolinayen were taken off from them, and they were surprised, for they did not know when their old clothes had been taken
off.

</p>
<p id="d0e2925">When they reached the other side Apon&#299;balagen said to the people who lived with Kadayadawan. &#8220;We are ashamed to come up into
the town, for we have no clothes.&#8221; Then the betel-nuts told Kadayadawan and he said, &#8220;Ala, go and tell them that I will come
and bring some clothes for them.&#8221; Not long after he arrived where they were and he gave them some clothes to use. &#8220;Ala, take
these clothes and use them, and come up to the town.&#8221; But Apon&#299;balagen and his companions were ashamed. Kadayadawan urged
them until they accepted the clothes.

</p>
<p id="d0e2927">Soon they reached the town and they danced and Iwaginan and Nagten-ng&#7431;yan danced again and the water from the river went up
into the town and the fish bit her feet. Not long after that they stopped dancing and Iwaginan made Gawigawen and Apon&#299;bolinayen
dance. While they were dancing Gawigawen watched Apon&#299;bolinayen, and when they had danced around nine times Gawigawen seized
her and put her in his belt.<a id="d0e2929src" href="#d0e2929" class="noteref">79</a> &#8220;Why do you do that Gawigawen?&#8221; said Kadayadawan to him, and he threw his spear and Gawigawen fell down and Apon&#299;bolinayen
escaped and Kadayadawan put her in a room. As soon as he put her in the room he went to bring Gawigawen back to life. Not
long after he revived him, &#8220;Why did you do that, Gawigawen? I did not steal Apon&#299;bolinayen from you.&#8221; And Gawigawen said,
&#8220;Even if you did steal Apon&#299;bolinayen from me, she was my wife and I could not find her until now. That is why I put her in
my belt, and Apon&#299;balagen knows that she is my wife.&#8221; And Kadayadawan said, &#8220;She is my wife now.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e2939">Not long after the <i>alan</i> who took care of Kadayadawan told Langa-an &#8220;Kadayadawan is your son. I picked him up when he was only blood which fell from
you.&#8221;<a id="d0e2944src" href="#d0e2944" class="noteref">80</a> &#8220;Why do you say that you are not my mother?&#8221; said Kadayadawan to the <i>alan</i>. Langa-an said to the <i>alan</i>, &#8220;It is good if he is my son.&#8221; They were very happy and they said to Apon&#299;balagen, &#8220;Now we will pay the marriage price and
also the price which Gawigawen <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2956"></a>Page 64</span>paid before, we will repay to him.&#8221; Apon&#299;balagen agreed, &#8220;You fill my <i>balaua</i> nine times with valuable things.&#8221; Not long after they filled the <i>balaua</i> nine times with valuable things and they repaid Gawigawen what he had paid when he married Apon&#299;bolinayen. When they had
paid they danced again. &#8220;Ala, now we must go home, for we have staid here a month,&#8221; said the people from the other towns.
So they went home and they took Apon&#299;bolinayen's marriage price.

</p>
<p id="d0e2964">&#8220;Ala, now my cousin <i>alan</i>, we are going to take Apon&#299;tolau<a id="d0e2969src" href="#d0e2969" class="noteref">81</a> home for you have said he is our son,&#8221; and the <i>alan</i> said, &#8220;Yes, take all of my things. I took him for I had no children to inherit my possessions.&#8221; So they took them to Kadalayapan.
The <i>alan</i> went to the other part of the world, and Langa-an used magic so that the golden house which the <i>alan</i> gave to Apon&#299;tolau went to their town of Kadalayapan. Not long after the golden house arrived and the people were surprised
when they woke up in the morning and saw the big golden house. Not long after Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen and their father
arrived there.

<p id="d0e2981">(Told by Magwati of Lagangilang.)

</p><a id="d0e2983"></a><h2>6</h2>
<p id="d0e2986">There was a woman whose name was Ginambo of Gon&#299;gonan, who went to fight Apon&#299;bolinayen of Kaodanan. When she reached the
place where the spring was she said, &#8220;You people who are dipping water from the spring, whose place is this where the spring
is?&#8221; &#8220;It belongs to Apon&#299;bolinayen of Kaodanan,&#8221; they said and when they went up to the town they raised a clamor. &#8220;What are
you so noisy about, you women who are like me?&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;You ask why we are noisy? Because there are many women,
who have come to fight against you, at the place where the spring is,&#8221; they said, and Apon&#299;bolinayen hurried to take her spear.
&#8220;What are you so noisy for, women like Apon&#299;bolinayen?&#8221; asked her father Pagatip&aacute;nan. &#8220;What are we noisy about, you ask? Because
there are many of my enemies at the spring.&#8221; &#8220;Do not go Apon&#299;bolinayen, for I will go.&#8221; &#8220;No for you are weak. What can you
do now? Once you did kill people in the place where the spring is, and now perhaps it is my fortune,&#8221; she said, and she went
to the spring. She looked down and truly the enemies looked like many locusts about the spring. &#8220;Ala,&#8221; said Ginambo of Gon&#299;gonan, &#8220;You people who live with me, you are anxious to carry away this woman whom we do not like.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; they answered, &#8220;but only our names will go back to the towns we came from,&#8221; i.e. they expected to be killed. Ginambo
answered, &#8220;No, we are anxious to capture her without fail.&#8221;
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e2990"></a>Page 65</span></p>
<p id="d0e2991">Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;You old enemy take this betel-nut,&#8221; and she cut it in two and gave it to them. &#8220;How are we sure Ginambo
of Gon&#299;gonan that only our names will not go back, we are afraid.&#8221; Ginambo said, &#8220;Do not be afraid, but hurry to be brave.&#8221;
&#8220;Ala, now do what you can,&#8221; shouted Apon&#299;bolinayen who stood on a high rock. When they started toward Apon&#299;bolinayen their
spears looked like rain they were so many. She glanced off the spears with both elbows. &#8220;Now I am the next to throw my spears,&#8221;
said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;Yes, because all our weapons are gone,&#8221; they said.

</p>
<p id="d0e2993">Apon&#299;bolinayen was next, she said, &#8220;I will use my magic, and you, my spear, shall kill six and seven at one time, and you,
my headaxe, cut off their heads from the left side and from the right side, and in back and in front.&#8221; &#8220;Ala, you spare me
so that I may tell the people in Gon&#299;gonan where I live,&#8221; said Ginambo. &#8220;Yes, but next month I will come to your town Gon&#299;gonan
to fight,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen.

</p>
<p id="d0e2995">Ginambo went home alone to her town. &#8220;Why are you alone?&#8221; asked the people who lived in the same town when she arrived. &#8220;What
can we do, all my companions who went to fight are lost, because they did not throw their spears at Apon&#299;bolinayen.&#8221; &#8220;That
is what we told you Ginambo of Gon&#299;gonan when you started, but you did not heed, you know that the people of Kaodanan are
powerful like Kabon&#299;yan.&#8221;<a id="d0e2997src" href="#d0e2997" class="noteref">82</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e3000">Soon after that G&#299;n&aacute;wan of Nagtinawan said, &#8220;You people who live in the same town in which I live, let us go to fight Apon&#299;gawan&#299;
of Kadalayapan.&#8221; &#8220;No, we do not wish to go, because the people who live in Kadalayapan are powerful like Kabon&#299;yan. We do
not know whether she has a brother or not though someone has said that Apon&#299;gawan&#299; has no brother.&#8221; &#8220;No we go,&#8221; said G&#299;n&aacute;wan.
&#8220;If that is what you say, we will go,&#8221; said the people. So they went and they walked and walked until they reached the spring
at Kadalayapan. G&#299;n&aacute;wan said, &#8220;You women who are dipping water from the spring, to whom does it belong?&#8221; &#8220;To Apon&#299;gawan&#299;,&#8221;
they said. G&#299;nawan said, &#8220;Ala, you go and tell your bravest that we fight with steel weapons.&#8221; The women who dipped water
from the well said, &#8220;We do not know who is the bravest, whom we should tell, for Apon&#299;gawan&#299; has no brother.&#8221; They went up
to the town, and said, &#8220;Uncle Pagbok&aacute;san the place about the spring is filled with enemies.&#8221; Then Apon&#299;gawan&#299; was in a hurry
to go. &#8220;Do not go you will kill somebody,&#8221; said her father. &#8220;No, father, the spring will be lost and then what can we do?
Father, I am a woman and since I have no brother, perhaps it is my fortune to fight, for you are weak.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3002">She took her skirt, headaxe, and spear and she went to the edge of <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3004"></a>Page 66</span>the hill above the spring. She looked and looked at the place where the spring was for truly the enemies were thick like locusts
about the well. &#8220;What did you come for?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;We come to fight the people who live in Kadalayapan, because we have
heard that the woman who is always in the house<a id="d0e3006src" href="#d0e3006" class="noteref">83</a> has no brother, so we have come to carry her away,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Ala, if you wish to prove her bravery you take this betel-nut.&#8221;
She cut it in two pieces and gave it to them. &#8220;We asked you to excuse us from going G&#299;n&aacute;wan,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Ala, you begin and
see what you can do,&#8221; said Apon&#299;gawan&#299; who stood on a high stone and she stood with her hands on her hips while they threw
their weapons. &#8220;Now, I am next,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You, my spear, when I throw you, kill at once seven and six; and you, my headaxe,
cut off their heads from the left and right sides, from in back and in front.&#8221; When Apon&#299;gawan&#299; had killed all of them except
G&#299;n&aacute;wan and she had all their weapons, G&#299;n&aacute;wan said, &#8220;Please, my friend, let me live so that someone may go back to the town
we came from.&#8221; &#8220;Ala, yes, if that is what you ask, my friend, but I will come next to your town,&#8221; she said, and G&#299;n&aacute;wan went
home alone. Not long after that the month which they had agreed on came.

</p>
<p id="d0e3012">&#8220;Now, mother, go and make cakes and after that I will go to fight,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;Do not go,&#8221; said her mother Ebang
of Kaodanan, but she could not detain her, so she made the cake, and when she finished, Apon&#299;bolinayen went.

</p>
<p id="d0e3014">&#8220;Mother, make preparations for me to go to war, for this is the month we agreed upon with G&#299;n&aacute;wan of Nagtinawan,&#8221; said Apon&#299;gawan&#299;
to her mother Langa-an of Kadalayapan.

</p>
<p id="d0e3016">Bye and bye Apon&#299;bolinayen who was walking in the middle of the road, stopped because she was tired. Apon&#299;gawan&#299; was also
walking and when she looked up she saw a woman to whom none compared, and she was startled, and she said, &#8220;Here is a woman
who looks like me. I do not like to approach her who looks like me, yet I am ashamed not to do so, for she has seen me,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; said Apon&#299;gawan&#299; to Apon&#299;bolinayen who sat on a high stone by the road. They leaned their spears together
between them and then they talked. &#8220;Now, my friend, where are you going,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;I am going to war,&#8221; said Apon&#299;gawan&#299;.
&#8220;And where are you going?&#8221; said Apon&#299;gawan&#299; to Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;I am going to Gon&#299;gonan, because the month which I agreed
upon with Ginambo of Gon&#299;gonan has come,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;Ala, let us chew betel-nut.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, if that is what you say,
we will chew betel-nut,&#8221; said Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. After that they <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3018"></a>Page 67</span>exchanged quids. And the quid which had been chewed by Apon&#299;gawan&#299; was covered with agate beads which are called <i>p&#299;nogalan</i>, and the quid of Apon&#299;bolinayen was covered with gold. Apon&#299;gawan&#299; said, &#8220;You are more beautiful and have more power than
I, because your betel-nut is covered with gold.&#8221; After that they spat in front of them. The place looked like the place where
a child had been born. &#8220;Now, my friend, we are going to tell our names.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said each one, and they told their names.
&#8220;I am Apon&#299;bolinayen of Kaodanan who has no brother, and Ginambo of Gon&#299;gonan came to fight against me and the month in which
we agreed to fight has come, so I go meet her.&#8221; &#8220;I go also to the town of G&#299;n&aacute;wan of Nagtinawan, because the month which we
agreed on has arrived, my name is Apon&#299;gawan&#299; of Kadalayapan who also has no brother.&#8221; &#8220;If that is what you are going to do,
we will go first to Gon&#299;gonan, then we will go to the town of Nagtinawan,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen to her. &#8220;If that is what you
say we will both go.&#8221; So they went.

</p>
<p id="d0e3023">Not long after they arrived at Gon&#299;gonan. &#8220;Now, Ginambo of Gon&#299;gonan I am here because the month which we agreed has come.&#8221;
&#8220;You people who live in the same town with me prepare, because the woman who always stays in the house in Kaodanan has come
to fight against us,&#8221; said Ginambo. &#8220;Yes, Ginambo, we will fight against her. We told you not to go against her before, because
the people of her town are related to Kabon&#299;yan. We do not know what magic they may use,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Now, what can we do,
we are lost.&#8221; After that they began to fight. &#8220;Ala, you my spears and headaxes kill the people from the left and the right
sides, from in back and in front,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen and Apon&#299;gawan&#299;.

</p>
<p id="d0e3025">As soon as they commanded their spears and headaxes their invisible helpers flew and they went to Dangdang&aacute;yan of Naglitnan.
&#8220;Oh, sir, you are so happy, who are in bed in the house. The people who live in Gon&#299;gonan have nearly killed your sister,
because she went to fight against them,&#8221; said the helpers. After that he went to bathe and wash his hair. &#8220;Ala, you three
girls take the rice straw and wash my hair,&#8221; he said, and the three girls washed his hair. After that he finished to wash
and he went up to the town. As soon as they arrived in the town the three girls combed his hair. When they finished to comb
his hair, &#8220;Now, you put little golden beads on each of my hairs,&#8221; he said. As soon as they put all the gold in his hair he
took his spear and headaxe and he went.

</p>
<p id="d0e3027">Ling&#299;wan of Nagtangpan was in bed in his house. &#8220;Sir, you are so happy in your bed in your house, your sister went to fight
and the enemies have nearly killed her,&#8221; said the invisible spirit helpers. &#8220;Mother <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3032"></a>Page 68</span><i>alan</i> I ask you if I have a sister? I never have seen her.&#8221; &#8220;What can you do? I picked you up where you had fallen when your father
was jealous of your mother,&#8221;<a id="d0e3036src" href="#d0e3036" class="noteref">84</a> she said. After that he hurried to start and he went.

</p>
<p id="d0e3039">When Dangdang&aacute;yan of Naglitnan was in the road, he sat down on a high stone where the two women had set before. How terrible
it is that those women who never go out of the house have gone to war, for here is where they exchanged their weapons. While he was sitting, &#8220;Good morning, my friend,&#8221; said Ling&#299;wan of Nagtangpan. &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; said the man who sat
on the high stone. &#8220;I am going anywhere,&#8221; he answered, and they talked. &#8220;We are going to tell our names, because it is bad
for us when we do not know each others names.&#8221; They cut and chewed the betel-nut. As soon as they chewed they found that they
were relatives. &#8220;My name is Ling&#299;wan of Nagtangpan.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Dangdang&aacute;yan of Naglitnan. Let us go together when we go
to fight.&#8221; After that they went. When they truly arrived they looked into the town, they saw the two women who looked like
flames of fire, because of their beauty. &#8220;How terrible that those ladies who always stay in the house have gone to war,&#8221; they
said. After that they went to them, and the people whom they killed were so many that the pig troughs floated in their blood.
So they went to them. When the women saw them they said, &#8220;How terrible are those two rich men who have power.&#8221; After that,
&#8220;Oh, ladies how were you born,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Why are you here you ask? Ginambo came to fight against us, that is why we are
here in the town of Gon&#299;gonan.&#8221; So Dangdang&aacute;yan went in front of them, and he scooped them up with his headaxe and put them
inside of his belt.<a id="d0e3043src" href="#d0e3043" class="noteref">85</a> After that the two men fought against the enemies. &#8220;Please leave someone to bear children,&#8221; said Ginambo of Gon&#299;gonan. &#8220;If
that is what you ask we will kill you last,&#8221; they said and she begged mercy.

</p>
<p id="d0e3049">&#8220;Now we will go to Nagtinawan which is the town of G&#299;n&aacute;wan, with whom Apon&#299;gawan&#299; agreed to fight this month.&#8221; After that,
&#8220;You plunder and heads go before us to Kadalayapan, when you arrive at the gate you divide equally and part of you go to Kaodanan.&#8221;
So they went to Nagtinawan. When they arrived in Nagtinawan, &#8220;You G&#299;n&aacute;wan of this town now the agreed month is here.&#8221; &#8220;How
are you G&#299;n&aacute;wan? We told you not to go before and you went; now we will all be killed,&#8221; said the people who lived in the same
town. &#8220;Now we seek vengeance.&#8221; They looked as if they cut down banana trees when they cut down their <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3051"></a>Page 69</span>enemies. &#8220;Please spare me, and if you wish marry me,&#8221; said G&#299;n&aacute;wan. &#8220;If that is what you say we will kill you last,&#8221; but they
did not kill her.

</p>
<p id="d0e3053">After that they went home and sent all the heads before them and also the plunder. After that they arrived in Kaodanan. &#8220;Good
afternoon, Uncle,&#8221; said Dangdang&aacute;yan to old man Pagbok&aacute;san. &#8220;Come up the ladder,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You go and cook so that these
boys may eat,&#8221; he said. After that, &#8220;You go and get one jar of <i>basi</i> which you used to like when you were young,&#8221; said his wife Ebang. As soon as she said this they went and they drank, and
Pagbok&aacute;san said to them. &#8220;This is reserved for Apon&#299;bolinayen to drink when she returns from fighting.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3058">When the old woman had finished cooking, she took the rice from the jar and put it on the woven basket, and she took the meat
from the jar and put it in the coconut shells, and so they ate. As soon as they finished to eat, &#8220;Now we are not going to
stay long, because we must go home,&#8221; they said. So Dangdang&aacute;yan dropped down the women who never go out of the house. &#8220;Why
Apon&#299;bolinayen is here and Ling&#299;wan also,&#8221; they said. Dingowan of Nagtangpan took Apon&#299;bolinayen and put her inside of a big
jar; then they went to Kadalayapan, because they went to take Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. When they arrived they said, &#8220;Good afternoon Uncle,&#8221;
to the old man Pagatip&aacute;nan. &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; he answered, and he was glad. &#8220;Come up,&#8221; he said. When they went up the stairs
they were given <i>basi</i>. While they were drinking they let Apon&#299;gawan&#299; fall in front of them, and they were all glad, because Apon&#299;gawan&#299; was there.
&#8220;How fine that Apon&#299;gawan&#299; is here; we feared that she was lost,&#8221; said the old man and woman. &#8220;Ala, boys if you go home now,
return soon for we are going to chew betel nut.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3066">As soon as they went <i>Lakay</i><a id="d0e3070src" href="#d0e3070" class="noteref">86</a> Pagatip&aacute;nan and his wife built <i>balaua</i>, and they called one woman medium<a id="d0e3076src" href="#d0e3076" class="noteref">87</a> to begin their <i>balaua</i>. As soon as they built their <i>balaua</i> they sent someone to go and secure betel-nuts which were covered with gold. Not long after the betel-nuts which were covered
with gold arrived and the old woman Langa-an oiled them, and she used magic so that the betel-nuts went to invite all their
relatives, who lived in other towns, to attend <i>balaua</i> with them. She told the betel-nuts that if any did not wish to attend <i>balaua</i> with them, to grow on their knees. As soon as she commanded them they went, and the betel-nut which went to Kaodanan arrived,
&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; it said to the old man, Pagbok&aacute;san who was lying in the <i>balaua</i>. He looked up and said, &#8220;Who was that,&#8221; and he saw it was a betel-nut, covered with gold and oiled, and the betel-nut said,
&#8220;I come to bid you attend the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3100"></a>Page 70</span><i>balaua</i> of Pagatip&aacute;nan of Kadalayapan, because Apon&#299;gawan&#299; has returned from fighting. So they celebrate.&#8221; Pagbok&aacute;san sat up. After
that he went down out of the <i>balaua</i> and the told people to wash their hair and clothes and to bathe so as to attend the <i>balaua</i> of Pagatip&aacute;nan of Kadalayapan. So the people who lived with them all went to the river and washed their clothes and hair,
and took a bath. As soon as they finished they went home, and they started to go to Kadalayapan. Old man Pagbok&aacute;san took Apon&#299;bolinayen
from the jar, and put her inside of his belt, so they went.

</p>
<p id="d0e3110">As soon as they arrived there the families who made the <i>balaua</i> went to meet them at the gate of the town and made <i>alawig</i><a id="d0e3117src" href="#d0e3117" class="noteref">88</a> for them. After that they stopped dancing, and they talked to each other, and the two young men who met Apon&#299;bolinayen and
Apon&#299;gawan&#299; were with them, because they arrived at the same time. So the old man Pagatip&aacute;nan said, &#8220;Ala, cousin Pagbok&aacute;san
now we are going to chew betel-nut to see if those two young men who took home Apon&#299;gawan&#299; are our relatives,&#8221; and old man
Pagbok&aacute;san agreed. So they cut the betel-nut which was covered with gold for them to chew and as soon as they cut the nut
they all chewed, and they all spat. The spittle of Ling&#299;wan went to the spittle of Pagatip&aacute;nan, and the spittle of Apon&#299;gawan&#299;, went there also. The spittle of Dangdang&aacute;yan went to the spittle of Pagbok&aacute;san
and that of Apon&#299;bolinayen also, and thus they found out that they were relatives. Pagbok&aacute;san was surprised, for he did not
know that he had a son, and Ebang took her son, and she carried him as if he was a baby. And Ling&#299;wan was glad, because he
had met his sister during the fight and Langa-an carried him as if a baby.

</p>
<p id="d0e3126">When they had learned that the boys who had carried the girls home were their sons they all went back to town, and their people
who had been invited were there. As soon as they sat down Iwaginan commanded someone to play the <i>gansas</i> and he took the two skirts and made everyone dance. His wife Gintoban who was a big woman, who used the big jars like agate
beads on her head and about her neck, said to Iwaginan, &#8220;Why don't you, my husband, bid me dance? I have been waiting for
a very long time.&#8221; Iwaginan said, &#8220;Gintoban do not say that or I shall be ashamed before the people. Wait until I am ready
for you.&#8221; As soon as Apon&#299;bolinayen and Ling&#299;wan finished dancing Iwaginan took the skirts from them and he gave one to Gintoban
and the other to Ilw&#299;san, and so they danced. And the big jars which she had hung around her neck made a noise and the earth
shook when she moved her body. As soon as they finished dancing the people who went to attend <i>Balaua</i> <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3134"></a>Page 71</span>with them said, &#8220;Now we going to put the heads around the town and then go for it is nearly one month now and our families
are lonesome for us.&#8221; So they went to put the heads on the sticks around the town.

</p>
<p id="d0e3136">At that time the two <i>alan</i> who had picked up Ling&#299;wan and Dangdang&aacute;yan arrived. They did not wish to attend <i>Balaua</i>, but the betel-nut had grown on their heads and they had arrived very late. As soon as Ling&#299;wan and Dangdang&aacute;yan saw them
they took them back to the town. As soon as Pagatip&aacute;nan knew that they were the <i>alan</i> who took care of the boys he summoned the people around the town. They danced for one month. After that Langa-an and Ebang
went to talk with the two <i>alan</i>, and said to them, &#8220;We are surprised for we did not feel our sons come out.&#8221; The <i>alan</i> said, &#8220;Ling&#299;wan I picked up by the side of the road while you were walking, that is why you did not feel him; he was a little
bloody when I picked him up, and I made him a man because I have no child to inherit all my things. Now that you found out
that he is your son you come and take all my things in Kabinbinlan, as soon as the <i>Balaua</i> is finished. As soon as you will get all of them I will fly somewhere.&#8221; So when the people went home, after the <i>Balaua</i> was finished, Ling&#299;wan and Dangdang&aacute;yan went to follow their <i>alan</i> mothers. As soon as they arrived in the different places where the <i>alan</i> lived they gave them all the things which they had and they used their power so that all the things went to their town. When
all the things arrived in Kadalayapan the people in the town were frightened, for there was a golden house. When the things
arrived in Kaodanan the people were frightened for there were the valuable things which Dangdang&aacute;yan took with him.

</p>
<p id="d0e3165">After one month passed Ling&#299;wan said to his father Pagatip&aacute;nan, &#8220;You go and make <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> for Apon&#299;bolinayen for I want to marry her.&#8221; So his father sent his wife Langa-an to Kaodanan to tell to the father and mother
of Apon&#299;bolinayen that Ling&#299;wan wished to marry her. So Langa-an took her hat which looked like the Salaks&aacute;k<a id="d0e3170src" href="#d0e3170" class="noteref">89</a> and her new skirt. As soon as she dressed she started and went. When she arrived in Kaodanan Pagbok&aacute;san was lying down in
his <i>balaua</i>. &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; she said to him. Pagbok&aacute;san was a in hurry to sit up and he said to her, &#8220;I am glad to see you, what are
you coming here for in the middle of the day.&#8221; &#8220;What am I coming for you say? I am coming to see if you want Ling&#299;wan for
a son for he wishes to marry Apon&#299;bolinayen.&#8221; Pagbok&aacute;san took her to his house and said to his wife, &#8220;Here is cousin Langa-an
who came to see us.&#8221; So Ebang told him that he should get some old <i>basi</i> for them to drink.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3179"></a>Page 72</span></p>
<p id="d0e3180">As soon as they drank Ebang went to cook. As soon as she finished cooking they ate. After they finished eating they took the
big coconut shell and filled it with <i>basi</i> and each of them drank, and they were all drunk, and Langa-an said, &#8220;I like to hear from you if you wish Ling&#299;wan to be a
son.&#8221; Soon Pagbok&aacute;san and Ebang agreed. They decided on the day for <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>. So Langa-an went home and when she arrived she laid down on the porch of the house for she was drunk, and Ling&#299;wan saw her
and waked her. &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am drunk for Pagbok&aacute;san and Ebang urged me to drink much <i>basi</i>, so I was scarcely able to get home, that is why I slept on the porch.&#8221; &#8220;Mother, you go into the house, do not sleep on the
porch.&#8221; So she went in and Ling&#299;wan asked her the result of her visit to Kaodanan. &#8220;They accepted you and we agreed to make
<i>pak&aacute;lon</i> the day after tomorrow.&#8221; So Ling&#299;wan was glad, and went to tell the people about his marriage, and all the people prepared
so that they might go.

</p>
<p id="d0e3197">As soon as the agreed day came they went to Kaodanan and they took many pigs and <i>basi</i> jars. When they arrived there Pagbok&aacute;san, who was the father of Apon&#299;bolinayen, and the other people were already there and
had cooked many caldrons of rice and meat. Pagbok&aacute;san took the <i>gansa</i><a id="d0e3204src" href="#d0e3204" class="noteref">90</a> and he commanded someone to play and they danced. After that they ate. As soon as they finished to eat they played the <i>gansa</i> again and they danced. Iwaginan of Pindayan said, &#8220;Stop playing the <i>gansas</i> we are going to settle on how much they must pay for Apon&#299;bolinayen. As soon as we agree we will dance.&#8221; And the people were
quiet and they agreed how much Ling&#299;wan was to pay. The father and mother of Ling&#299;wan offered the <i>balaua</i> three times full of jars which are <i>malayo</i> and <i>tadogan</i> and <i>ginlasan.</i><a id="d0e3224src" href="#d0e3224" class="noteref">91</a> The people did not agree and they said, &#8220;Five times full, if you do not have that many Ling&#299;wan may not marry Apon&#299;bolinayen.&#8221;
He was so anxious to marry her that he told his parents to agree to what the people said. As soon as they agreed Langa-an
used magic so that all the jars which the people wanted were already in the <i>balaua</i>&#8212;five times full. As soon as they gave all the jars which they paid, Iwaginan ordered them to play the gansas and they danced.
After they danced, all their relatives who went to attend <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> were anxious to go home for they had been there one month. &#8220;Do not detain us, for we are one month here.&#8221; So Pagbok&aacute;san let
them go. Everyone carried home some jars and they all went home.<a id="d0e3236src" href="#d0e3236" class="noteref">92</a> So Pagatip&aacute;nan said to Pagbok&aacute;san, &#8220;Now that the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> is over we <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3242"></a>Page 73</span>will take Apon&#299;bolinayen, because Ling&#299;wan wants her now.&#8221; Pagbok&aacute;san said, &#8220;Do not take her now. You come and bring Ling&#299;wan
day after tomorrow.&#8221; &#8220;If that is what you say we will bring him, if you will not let us take Apon&#299;bolinayen now.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3247">When they started to go home Pagbok&aacute;san said to them, &#8220;Dangdang&aacute;yan wants to marry Apon&#299;gawan&#299; who is your daughter.&#8221; &#8220;You
will wait until next month,&#8221; said Langa-an. &#8220;After Apon&#299;bolinayen and Ling&#299;wan are married, we will think first.&#8221; Not long
after the day on which they agreed to take Ling&#299;wan to Apon&#299;bolinayen came, and he carried one jar.<a id="d0e3249src" href="#d0e3249" class="noteref">93</a> As soon as they arrived there they made the rice ceremony.<a id="d0e3252src" href="#d0e3252" class="noteref">94</a> When the ceremony was over Pagatip&aacute;nan and Langa-an and the others went home and left Ling&#299;wan.

</p>
<p id="d0e3258">As soon as they arrived in Kadalayapan Langa-an asked Apon&#299;gawan&#299; if she wanted Dangdang&aacute;yan to be her husband. Apon&#299;gawan&#299;
said, &#8220;If you think it is good for me to be married now, and you think he is a good man for my husband it is all right, for
he has magical power like us.&#8221; As soon as the agreed month passed the parents of Dangdang&aacute;yan came to ask if they wished the
marriage. They prepared a number of <i>basi</i> jars for them to drink from when they should arrive. When they arrived there Pagatip&aacute;nan was prepared and he met them with
the <i>basi</i> and they all drank. After that they told all the people who lived in their town that they were going to celebrate the arrival
of Pagbok&aacute;san and his companions. &#8220;Ala, we do not stay long now, <i>Abal&aacute;yan</i>,<a id="d0e3269src" href="#d0e3269" class="noteref">95</a> we want to know if you wish Dangdang&aacute;yan to be married to Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. We will have a good time during <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>,&#8221; they said. After that Langa-an and Pagatip&aacute;nan said, &#8220;Now the meal is ready. We are going to eat first and after that you
will hear what we say.&#8221; And Pagbok&aacute;san and Ebang did not wish to eat for they were in a hurry and only went to hear if they
wished Dangdang&aacute;yan to be the husband of Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. &#8220;If you do not wish to come and eat with us, we do not want Dangdang&aacute;yan
to be married to Apon&#299;gawan&#299;,&#8221; they said. Then they all went to eat. After they ate, &#8220;Ala now that we have finished eating
you excuse us, for we want to know if you wish Dangdang&aacute;yan to be married to Apon&#299;gawan&#299;.&#8221; Langa-an and Pagatip&aacute;nan said,
&#8220;You will come next month, we will make <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>.&#8221; So they went home and Dangdang&aacute;yan went to meet them at the gate of the town, and he asked at once, &#8220;Father and mother
did they accept me?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, if we can agree on what they want us to pay, and we have to go there next month.&#8221; So <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3278"></a>Page 74</span>Dangdang&aacute;yan was glad and told the people about it, and he invited them to go the next month to make <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e3283">As soon as the agreed month to go to Kadalayanpan came, they went. As soon as they arrived there they danced for one month.
Ling&#299;wan and Apon&#299;bolinayen had their golden house, which the <i>alan</i> had given them. The people agreed on how much they should pay for the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>, and Pagatip&aacute;nan and Langa-an said, &#8220;Pay just the same as we paid for Apon&#299;bolinayen when Ling&#299;wan married her.&#8221; &#8220;If that
is what you say, it is all right,&#8221; they said. And Ebang used magic so that the <i>balaua</i> was five times full of jars which are <i>malayo, tadogan</i>, and <i>ginlasan.</i> So the <i>balaua</i> was filled five times, and each of the relatives who went to attend the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> took some jars. As soon as the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> was finished the people all went home, and Pagbok&aacute;san and Ebang said, &#8220;Ala, now that the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> is over let us take Apon&#299;gawan&#299;,&#8221; Langa-an answered, &#8220;If you make extra payment you can take Apon&#299;gawan&#299; now,&#8221; and Dangdang&aacute;yan
said to his mother, &#8220;If they want the extra payment, ask them how much.&#8221; Langa-an replied, &#8220;Another five times the <i>balaua</i> full,&#8221; and Ebang said to her son, &#8220;We have to pay again the <i>balaua</i> five times full.&#8221; &#8220;That is all right mother I have many jars which my <i>alan</i> mother gave me,&#8221; so they gave the extra jars which they asked. As soon as they gave all the jars they took Apon&#299;gawan&#299; of
Kaodanan with them. As soon as they arrived they made a big party, and they invited the <i>alan</i>. As soon as the <i>alan</i> arrived at the party they danced and gave more presents to them. After that the <i>alan</i> and the other people went home and Apon&#299;gawan&#299; and Dangdang&aacute;yan had their own house which the <i>alan</i> gave them. This is all.

<p id="d0e3338">Apon&#299;tolau told Apon&#299;bolinayen that they would go to the river to wash their hair. Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen went with
him. When they arrived at the spring they washed their hair. As soon as they washed their hair they went to get the <i>lawed</i><a id="d0e3342src" href="#d0e3342" class="noteref">96</a> vine and they went back home. As soon as they reached home Apon&#299;tolau said to Apon&#299;bolinayen, &#8220;Will you comb my hair? I am
anxious to go to fight.&#8221; So Apon&#299;bolinayen combed his hair. As soon as she combed it he said, &#8220;Ala, you go and get my clout,
my belt which is sewed with gold, and my striped coat, and also get my <i>ambosau</i>.&#8221;<a id="d0e3352src" href="#d0e3352" class="noteref">97</a> Apon&#299;bolinayen got them and Apon&#299;tolau dressed up. As soon as he was dressed he took his shield, his headaxe, and spear,
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3355"></a>Page 75</span>and went. He struck the side of his shield, and it sounded like one hundred people. While he was walking and striking his
shield in the middle of the way, Gimbagonan, the wife of Iwaginan, heard him, when he was near to Pindayan. When he passed
by the town he continued toward the town of G&#299;amb&oacute;lan. In a short time he arrived at the well of G&#299;amb&oacute;lan. He met the young
girls who were dipping water from the well. He killed all of them with his headaxe and spear. Not long after he cut off their
heads and he went up to the town and directly to the house of G&#299;amb&oacute;lan. When he arrived at the house, he said, &#8220;Good morning,
G&#299;amb&oacute;lan. Go and get your shield, headaxe and spear, and boar's tusk armlet for we are going to fight here in your yard.&#8221;
G&#299;amb&oacute;lan got his headaxe and spears for he wanted to fight. As soon as he arrived where Apon&#299;tolau was he threw his spears
at him and Apon&#299;tolau soon got all the spears which he threw. Then he tried to cut off Apon&#299;tolau's head, but Apon&#299;tolau got
his headaxe and said to him, &#8220;Now I am next, for you did not injure me at all,&#8221; and G&#299;amb&oacute;lan said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau commanded his headaxe and spear to go to G&#299;amb&oacute;lan's side as soon as he threw them;
so G&#299;amb&oacute;lan laid down and the headaxe went and cut off G&#299;amb&oacute;lan's ten heads.

</p>
<p id="d0e3360">As soon as Apon&#299;tolau had killed G&#299;amb&oacute;lan he again commanded his spear and headaxe to cut off the heads of all the people
in the houses and the headaxe and spear went and Apon&#299;tolau sat by the town waiting for them. As soon as the spear and headaxe
had killed all the people who lived in the town they went back to him and Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;You heads of the people gather
in one place, but you heads of G&#299;amb&oacute;lan and you heads of the women be separate from the others. You gather by the house of
G&#299;amb&oacute;lan.&#8221; Not long after all the heads gathered and he said again, &#8220;You heads of G&#299;amb&oacute;lango first, and you heads of the
men precede the women. As soon as you arrive in Kadalayapan stop by the gate of the town. You house of G&#299;amb&oacute;lango go directly
to my house in Kadalayapan. Go with the big storm.&#8221; So the house went. &#8220;You oranges of G&#299;amb&oacute;lan come and follow us.&#8221; So the
oranges followed them. He told them to go in front of his house. They went and Apon&#299;tolau followed them, and the oranges followed
him.

</p>
<p id="d0e3362">Not long after Apon&#299;tolau looked back and he saw the <i>alzados</i> following him, for they wished to kill him. As soon as he saw them he commanded his strike-a-light to become a high bank
so the <i>alzados</i> could not follow him.<a id="d0e3370src" href="#d0e3370" class="noteref">98</a> So the strike-a-light became a high bank, and the <i>alzados</i> were on the other side and could not follow him. Not long after he was near to Kadalayapan. As soon as he arrived there he
found all <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3379"></a>Page 76</span>the heads near the gate of the town and he said to them, &#8220;You heads of G&#299;amb&oacute;lan stay by the well, and you heads of the people
who lived with him gather here by the gate.&#8221; He went to the town and told the people to gather by the gate and play the <i>gansas</i> and dance, and he commanded someone to invite their friends in other towns. Not long after the people from the other towns
arrived in Kadalayapan, and the people who lived there were still dancing. Apon&#299;tolau danced with Danay of Kabisilan. The
next was his son Kanag Kabagbagowan who danced with five young girls who never go outdoors. As soon as they had all danced
they went to their towns. Then they put the heads around the town of Kadalayapan.

<p id="d0e3389">Apon&#299;bolinayen and Apon&#299;tolau were anxious to make <i>Sayang</i>,<a id="d0e3394src" href="#d0e3394" class="noteref">99</a> so Apon&#299;tolau asked Apon&#299;bolinayen about his clout and his striped belt. &#8220;Well, you go and get them, for I am going to get
the head of the old man To-&#333;dan of Kalask&#299;gan before we make <i>Sayang</i>.&#8221; So Apon&#299;bolinayen went to get his clout and belt. After that he oiled his hair and Apon&#299;bolinayen put a golden bead on each
hair. Not long after he went to get his headaxe and spear. As soon as Apon&#299;bolinayen gave him his provisions for the journey,
he started.

</p>
<p id="d0e3406">When he was in the middle of the way he became very tired, for it was far. So he used magic and he said, &#8220;I use my power so
that I will arrive at once at the town of To-&#333;dan of Kalask&#299;gan.&#8221; Soon after he arrived in Kalask&#299;gan. When he arrived at
the yard beside the <i>balaua</i><a href="#d0e3394" class="noteref">99</a> the old man was lying down. The old man saw him and said, &#8220;Eb, I have a man to eat.&#8221; And Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;You will never eat me. Go and get your headaxe and spear, for you must fight
with me. I will take your head before I make <i>Sayang</i>.&#8221; The old man was angry and he stood up and went to get his headaxe and spear. &#8220;You are the only person who ever came in
my town. Go on, and throw your spear, if you are brave,&#8221; said To-&#333;dan. &#8220;If I am the first to throw my spear you will never
have a chance to throw yours, for I will kill you at once. You better throw yours first,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. The old man was
angry, and he threw his spear. But his spear glanced off from the body of Apon&#299;tolau, for he used his power so that everything
glanced away from his body. The old man To-&#333;dan ran toward him and tried to cut off his head, but the headaxe could not cut
Apon&#299;tolau, and the old man To-&#333;dan <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3418"></a>Page 77</span>said to him, &#8220;You, truly, are a brave man, that was why you came to my town. Try and throw your spear at me, for if you can
hit me it is all right, for I have killed many people.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau threw his spear at his side, and it went clear through
his body and To-&#333;dan laid down. Apon&#299;tolau cut off his head.

</p>
<p id="d0e3420">Not long after Apon&#299;tolau went back home and Don Carlos of Kabaiganan (Vigan)<a id="d0e3422src" href="#d0e3422" class="noteref">100</a> was anxious to go and see Apon&#299;bolinayen. So he commanded his spirit companions to be ready to go with him to Kadalayapan.
As soon as they were ready he said to them, &#8220;You go first, my companions, we are going to the town of Apon&#299;bolinayen, for
I have heard that she is a pretty woman, and I wish to see her.&#8221; Not long after they arrived at the river, and they got on
to the raft. Soon they arrived at the well of Kadalayapan and Indi&aacute;pan was dipping water from the well, and Don Carlos spoke
to her. &#8220;Is this the well of Apon&#299;bolinayen?&#8221; Indi&aacute;pan said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8220;Will you go and tell her to come here and see what I
have to sell?&#8221; Indi&aacute;pan went up to the town and said &#8220;Apon&#299;bolinayen, Don Carlos wants you to see what he has to sell.&#8221; &#8220;I
don't wish to go and see what he has to sell.&#8221; So Indi&aacute;pan went back to the well and said to Don Carlos &#8220;Apon&#299;bolinayen does
not wish to come, and she does not wish to buy what you have to sell.&#8221; So he pondered what he should do. &#8220;The best thing for
me to do is to go to their house to get a drink.&#8221; So he went up to the town and said, &#8220;Good morning, Apon&#299;bolinayen, will
you give me some water to drink? For a long time I have wished to drink your water.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen answered, &#8220;Why did you
come from the well? Why did you not drink while you were there?&#8221; &#8220;I did not drink there, for I wished to drink of your water.&#8221;
Apon&#299;bolinayen did not give him any for she was afraid; then Don Carlos used magic so that she dropped her needle. The needle
dropped and she said to him, &#8220;Will you hand the needle which I dropped to me, Don Carlos.&#8221; So Don Carlos picked up the needle
and he put a love charm on it, and he gave it to her.<a id="d0e3425src" href="#d0e3425" class="noteref">101</a> Not long after Don Carlos wanted to go back home, but Apon&#299;bolinayen would not let him go, and she said, &#8220;Come up in the
house.&#8221; So he went up into the house.

</p>
<p id="d0e3437">Not long after Apon&#299;tolau shouted near to the town and he did not hear Apon&#299;bolinayen answer. As soon as he reached the gate
of the town he shouted again, and she did not answer, for Don Carlos was with her. Not long after Don Carlos went home and
Apon&#299;bolinayen saw his belt <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3439"></a>Page 78</span>which he had left, for he was in a hurry. So she ran and got the ladder to the rice granary, and she hid the belt. Apon&#299;tolau
met Don Carlos at the gate of the town and he asked him why he had gone into the town, and he answered, &#8220;I want to sell something.&#8221;
Not long after Apon&#299;tolau went to their house and asked Apon&#299;bolinayen why she did not reply to him when he shouted two times.
&#8220;I did not answer, for I have a headache.&#8221; &#8220;Why is the fastening on the door different from before?&#8221; &#8220;I don't know. No one
came in.&#8221; Not long after Apon&#299;tolau went up into the house. &#8220;Now, Apon&#299;bolinayen, I have taken the head of the old man To-&#333;dan
of Kalask&#299;gan. You command the people to begin to pound rice, for we will make <i>Sayang</i>&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3444">Not long after Apon&#299;tolau saw a flame of fire in the rice granary and he said, &#8220;Why is there a fire in the rice granary?&#8221;
So he ran to see. Not long after he went inside of the granary and he saw what it was. As soon as he saw that it was a golden
belt he said, &#8220;I think this is the belt of the man who came here while I was gone.&#8221; So he took it and hid it and did not let
Apon&#299;bolinayen see it. Not long after they commanded the people to go and get betel-nuts. When they arrived with the fruit
they oiled them and Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;Tell me whom we shall invite beside our relatives in the other towns.&#8221; And Apon&#299;bolinayen
told him to invite Don Carlos of Kabaiganan, for she wished always to see him. So they sent a betel-nut to go and get Don
Carlos, and they sent one to the old woman Alokot&aacute;n of Nagbotobot&aacute;n and Awig of Natpangan and other towns.

</p>
<p id="d0e3446">Not long after the betel-nut reached the place where Don Carlos lived and it met his spirit helpers. As soon as the betel-nut
reached Don Carlos, &#8220;Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen are making <i>Sayang</i>, and I came to invite you.&#8221; &#8220;All right, you go first. I will dress and go after you,&#8221; he said. Not long after he dressed
up and went to follow the betel-nuts. Not long after all the other people from the other towns arrived where they were making
<i>Sayang</i> and Apon&#299;tolau tried to put the belt on each person to see if it fitted and no one was the right size. As soon as Don Carlos
arrived Apon&#299;tolau tried the belt on him and it was all right. So Apon&#299;tolau gave him the belt and he got a golden chair and
he put it in the middle of the party and made Don Carlos sit on it. All of the people were dancing and Apon&#299;tolau went and
sharpened his headaxe. Not long after, &#8220;Ala, you Apon&#299;bolinayen take Kanag and Alama-an with you and dance with Don Carlos.&#8221;
Not long after they danced. While they were dancing Apon&#299;tolau cut off the head of Don Carlos. The head sprang up and went
to the breast of Apon&#299;bolinayen, and Apon&#299;bolinayen and Kanag and Alama-an ran away, and their clothes were torn, for they
ran through many thorns.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3454"></a>Page 79</span></p>
<p id="d0e3455">Not long after the people who went to attend the <i>Sayang</i> went home, and Apon&#299;bolinayen and Kanag and Alama-an arrived in a level plain. They went to the shade of an <i>alos&#299;p</i><a id="d0e3462src" href="#d0e3462" class="noteref">102</a> tree and they sat there many days, for they were very tired. &#8220;I am anxious to drink water,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen, and not
long after they heard a rooster crowing. &#8220;I think we are near a town, for I hear a rooster crowing.&#8221; So they went where they
had heard the rooster. &#8220;We go and drink,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. Not long after they reached the place where <i>Sil&#299;t</i> (one kind of lightning) and the dog <i>K&#299;mat</i><a id="d0e3472src" href="#d0e3472" class="noteref">103</a> guarded. <i>Sil&#299;t</i> and the dog were sleeping and did not see them go inside of the town. Soon they arrived in the yard of the golden house of
Balbala&#333;ga of Dona and they were ashamed to ask for water to drink, for they were naked. So they went to the <i>balaua</i> and slept, for they were tired.

</p>
<p id="d0e3481">While they were sleeping, Balbala&#333;ga saw them in his <i>balaua</i>, and he was surprised, because no one was permitted to enter the town, for <i>Sil&#299;t</i> and the dog prevented. He said, &#8220;What is the matter of the guards that they did not see those people enter the town? Perhaps
they are my relatives.&#8221; So he took some clothes to the <i>balaua</i> for them. He covered them with blankets while they slept. As soon as he covered them he sat down in the <i>balaua</i> and waited until they got up. As soon as Apon&#299;bolinayen awoke she saw him and said, &#8220;Do not wound us in many places, so we
will not need to cure so much.&#8221; Balbala&#333;ga said, &#8220;If I were an enemy I would have killed you while you slept. We are going
to chew betel-nut and see who you are.&#8221; So he cut a betel-nut and gave to them, and their spittle was like agate beads. So
he took them up into his golden house and told his mother <i>alan</i> to give them some clothes. Not long after they drank <i>basi</i>, after they had finished eating. All the <i>alan</i> were drunk and the mother of Balbala&#333;ga of Dona said to them, &#8220;Apon&#299;bolinayen, Balbala&#333;ga is your brother, for he was the after-birth of Awig, which they put in the <i>tabalang</i> which they sent down the stream.<a id="d0e3509src" href="#d0e3509" class="noteref">104</a> So I picked him up, for I had no child to inherit all my things.&#8221; Not long after they knew that they were brother and sister
Balbala&#333;ga asked his sister why they came to Dona without clothes. She said, &#8220;Apon&#299;tolau is jealous of Don Carlos and he cut
off his head, and the head jumped to my breasts, so we were frightened and ran away. That is why we came here. I did not know
I had a brother who lived here.&#8221; The head still hung to the breasts of Apon&#299;bolinayen, but they had not seen it before, for
she had covered it. As soon as she showed it to Balbala&#333;ga <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3515"></a>Page 80</span>he took the head from her breasts and they sent some betel-nuts to go and summon their mother.

</p>
<p id="d0e3517">As soon as the betel-nut arrived in Kaodanan it said to Pagbok&aacute;san and Ebang, &#8220;Good morning. I came here for Balbala&#333;ga, and
his sister sent me to come and get you.&#8221; So Ebang and Pagbok&aacute;san were surprised, because Apon&#299;bolinayen had another brother. So they called Awig and said to him,
&#8220;Here is a betel-nut from Dona which Apon&#299;bolinayen and Balbala&#333;ga sent, for they want to see us.&#8221; Awig said to them, &#8220;I don't
believe that Apon&#299;bolinayen is still alive, for we have searched for her a very long time, and I never heard of a place called
Dona, and I have been all over the world.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3522">They started and the betel-nut led them. &#8220;Where is Dona?&#8221; they said to the betel-nut. &#8220;Dona is somewhere. Follow me. You must
step on the big dishes where I step.&#8221; Not long after they arrived in the place where Balbala&#333;ga lived and were surprised at
the big golden house, and Balbala&#333;ga and Apon&#299;bolinayen were watching them from the window, and they went to the yard of the
house. Ebang and Pagbok&aacute;san did not believe that Balbala&#333;ga was their son, so they chewed betel-nut. As soon as they chewed
they found out that he was the after-birth of Awig. So Balbala&#333;ga took them into his house.

</p>
<p id="d0e3524">Not long after Balbala&#333;ga said to them, &#8220;Wait for me for awhile, for I am going to hunt deer.&#8221; So he called his dogs who talked
with the thunder, they were so big and also powerful. Not long after he went to the wood and the dogs caught three deer. He
cut up the deer and took them back home.

</p>
<p id="d0e3526">Not long after Apon&#299;tolau heard that Apon&#299;bolinayen was with her brother in Dona. He went to follow her, for he intended to
live with her again. Ebang and Pagbok&aacute;san took Balbala&#333;ga and Apon&#299;bolinayen to Kaodanan, and they used their power so that
all the things which the <i>alan</i> had given to Balbala&#333;ga went to Kaodanan. Not long after the house and the other things which the <i>alan</i> had given went to Kaodanan, all the <i>alan</i> flew away. Not long after they made <i>balaua</i> in Kaodanan, and they called all their relatives in the other towns and all of the <i>alan</i> who cared for Balbala&#333;ga of Dona. After that all the people went to attend their <i>balaua</i>. In that time Balbala&#333;ga was married and Apon&#299;tolau was very sorry, because he could not remarry Apon&#299;bolinayen, and he went
to the <i>balaua</i> even though he was not invited. As soon as the <i>balaua</i> was over, all the people went back home, but Balbala&#333;ga did not go back to Dona. The <i>alan</i> flew away after he was married.

<p id="d0e3562">Ayo went to the spring. When she went she met Dagdagal&#299;sit, who was fishing in the river. When she reached him she became
pregnant. Not long after she went home. When she arrived in her house the space between the little finger and the next itched.
&#8220;Bolinayen, you stick the needle in my finger where it itches. I do not know what makes it itch so,&#8221; she said. As soon as
Bolinayen stuck the needle the little baby popped out.<a id="d0e3564src" href="#d0e3564" class="noteref">105</a> &#8220;What shall we name the baby?&#8221; &#8220;Dagol&aacute;yan will be his name.&#8221; The baby shook his head, so they gave him the name Kanag.

</p>
<p id="d0e3570">Awig went to wash his hair in the spring. When he finished washing his hair he went home. When he reached his house he made
Ayo louse him. While Ayo was lousing him the milk from her breasts dropped on Awig's legs. &#8220;Why, Ayo, does the milk from your
breasts drop on my legs?&#8221; he asked. He sat up and asked them many times until they brought the baby. When they brought the
baby, &#8220;We are going home to Natpangan now, because it does not do me any good to try and hide you.&#8221; He took them home and
soon he made a bamboo bench by the gate of the town where the people passed when they went to the well, and he placed the
baby on it. Then they built <i>balaua</i>, for he wanted to see the father of the baby. Not long after he commanded some one to go and get betel-nuts and he oiled
them. He sent them to go and invite all the people in the world. When they arrived none of them wanted the baby to recognize
them. When the baby did not go to any of them, he sent someone to get a betel-nut to send to Dagdagal&#299;sit whom they had not
invited. As soon as the betel-nut arrived at the place where Dagdagal&#299;sit lived &#8220;Dagdagal&#299;sit came to Natpangan for Awig makes
<i>balaua</i>,&#8221; it said. &#8220;I cannot go, for I am ashamed, because I have no good clothes,&#8221; he said, for his clout was the dried bark of
a banana tree. &#8220;If you do not come I will grow on your big pig,&#8221; it said, and the betel-nut jumped on the back of the big
pig, and it began to squeal. When his big pig began squealing loudly, because the tree grew on his back, Dagdagal&#299;sit said,
&#8220;I come now.&#8221; Not long after he went. When he came walking up the trail from the spring the baby saw him, and went to him,
and Awig saw him carrying the baby. &#8220;I did not think it would happen this way to Apon&#299;bolinayen,&#8221; he said. Then he sent Apon&#299;bolinayen
away, and he made her carry the poor house box that they used to put the fish in which Dagdagal&#299;sit caught in the river. &#8220;You
carry the female pig so that you have something to eat by the river,&#8221; said Awig to <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3578"></a>Page 82</span>Dagdagal&#299;sit. So they went; Apon&#299;bolinayen carried the poor box and Awig took her beads and clothes off from her, and he gave
her old clothes to use, and so they went.

</p>
<p id="d0e3580">When they were near the spring they threw away the things they carried, the female pig and poor box. While they were walking
near the town of Dagdagal&#299;sit, which was Kab&#7431;nb&#7431;nlan, Ayo saw the golden house. &#8220;We must not walk by the side of the golden
house, for I am ashamed before the man who owns it,&#8221; said Ayo to Dagdagal&#299;sit. They were still walking and Ayo followed him.
As soon as they arrived at the ladder Dagdagal&#299;sit went upstairs and Ayo did not because she thought that Dagdagal&#299;sit did
not own that house, and Dagdagal&#299;sit made her go up, and she did. As soon as she arrived above Dagdagal&#299;sit went to get rice
to give Ayo to cook. &#8220;Cook this, Ayo, while I go to catch fish for us to eat,&#8221; he said, and he went. As soon as he caught
two fish he went home, and he left the dry bark of the banana, which he used as a clout, by the river, and he became L&#299;g&#299;,<a id="d0e3582src" href="#d0e3582" class="noteref">106</a> so he went home. As soon as he arrived he made Ayo wake up, when he finished cooking the fish, and the baby went to him to
be carried. He called Ayo and she did not go. &#8220;I wait for my husband, we will both eat at one time, bye and bye,&#8221; she said,
and she took the baby which he carried, for she was ashamed. &#8220;No, I was Dagdagal&#299;sit, but used the bark of the banana tree
for a clout, because I changed my form. Let us eat.&#8221; So they ate. As soon as they finished eating, &#8220;We shall make <i>balaua</i> so that we invite all our relatives in the different towns, and we also shall invite Awig and Apon&#299;gonay,&#8221; he said. Not long
after he went and took the betel-nuts which he cut. When he had cut them all he oiled them and sent them to the different
towns.

</p>
<p id="d0e3588">When the people from the different towns arrived by the spring in Kab&#7431;nb&#7431;nlan they were surprised because all the stones of
the spring were of gold. Not long after they went up to the town. Next day Awig and Apon&#299;gonay started to go. &#8220;Ala, Apon&#299;gonay,
take rice so that we may cook it in Kab&#7431;nb&#7431;nlan, because Apon&#299;bolinayen and Dagdagal&#299;sit have no rice to cook. What will Dagdagal&#299;sit
use for his <i>balaua?</i> He ties a banana bark clout on his body. I do not think he has rice, so we will take some for us to eat. You people who live
in the same town we go to attend <i>balaua</i>. You take food with you for Apon&#299;bolinayen and Dagdagal&#299;sit make <i>balaua</i>.&#8221; Not long after they went, and when they arrived in the place where the spring is in Kab&#7431;nb&#7431;nlan they saw the beautiful
spring whose stones were all gold. The gravel which they used to wash the pottery with was all agates which have no holes
through <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3599"></a>Page 83</span>them. &#8220;I do not think that Dagdagal&#299;sit has a spring like this, for his clout is only the dry bark of the banana, but it is
best for us to go and see in the town.&#8221; They went, and when they had almost reached the town the golden house twinkled. &#8220;We
must not walk by the golden house,&#8221; said Awig. &#8220;We must not walk by that golden house, you say, but that is where the people
are dancing,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolnay. As they walked they saw that the men and women who were making <i>alawig</i><a id="d0e3603src" href="#d0e3603" class="noteref">107</a> were the companions of Apon&#299;bolinayen. Awig said, &#8220;That is the man who used to put the clout of banana leaves on him.&#8221; As
soon as Apon&#299;tolau<a id="d0e3609src" href="#d0e3609" class="noteref">108</a> and Apon&#299;bolinayen finished dancing they went to take the hands of Awig and Apon&#299;bolay, and Apon&#299;tolau commanded the people
who lived with them to bring golden seats. After that Apon&#299;tolau went to make Awig sit down. &#8220;You sit down, brother-in-law,
and we will forget the things which have passed.&#8221; Then he made him sit down and soon Awig and Asigt&aacute;nan danced. While they
were dancing Apon&#299;tolau went to cut off Awig's head. Not long after the women who never go outdoors<a id="d0e3612src" href="#d0e3612" class="noteref">109</a> went to bring Awig to life. As soon as they made him alive again, Apon&#299;tolau gave the marriage price. It was nine times full,
the <i>balaua</i>, and when Apon&#299;bolnay raised up her elbow half of it vanished, which was in the <i>balaua</i>. And Apon&#299;bolinayen used her power and the <i>balaua</i> was full again.

</p>
<p id="d0e3627">Not long after they chewed betel-nut and the quid of Langa-an and Pagatip&aacute;nan and the quids of Dagdagal&#299;sit went together,
and the quid of Pagbok&aacute;san and Ebang went to the quid of Apon&#299;bolinayen and Awig, and Langa-an and Pagatip&aacute;nan changed the
name of Dagdagal&#299;sit to L&#299;g&#299;. &#8220;Ala, now mother old <i>alan</i> do not feel sorry, for we take Apon&#299;tolau<a href="#d0e3609" class="noteref">108</a> to Kadalayapan,&#8221; said Langa-an. &#8220;Ala, yes, you take them, take all my valuable things. If it were not for me, Apon&#299;tolau
would not be alive, for you Langa-an had a miscarriage and lost him, when you went to wash your hair, so I picked him up,
because I had no one to inherit my possessions. Take all my things, so that Apon&#299;tolau and his wife may own them.&#8221; Not long
after they went home and Awig took all the payment for Apon&#299;bolinayen and all the <i>alan</i> flew away. So Awig and Apon&#299;tolau went to their towns.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3637"></a>Page 84</span></p><a id="d0e3638"></a><h2>10</h2>
<p id="d0e3641">Apon&#299;balagen went to put Apon&#299;bolinayen in Kabwa-an, where no one could see her. As soon as they arrived at the ocean they
rode on the crocodiles to Kabwa-an. When they arrived there Apon&#299;balagen used magic so that a big golden house stood in the
middle of a wide plain. In the yard were many betel-nut trees and a spring below the trees. The gravel where the stream flowed
was beads called <i>pagatpat</i> and <i>kodla</i>, and the leaves and grass used to rub the inside of the jars was a necklace of golden wire.

</p>
<p id="d0e3649">When the golden house, and betel-nuts, and spring had appeared, Apon&#299;balagen left an old woman with Apon&#299;bolinayen and Alama-an,
and Sinogyaman and Indi&aacute;pan, and he went back home, and he said to them, &#8220;Do not be afraid to stay, for no one can see you
here, where I have put you, and if anyone tries to come here the crocodiles will eat them. You have everything you need.&#8221;
So he went home.

</p>
<p id="d0e3651">Ingiwan who lived in Kabilab&#299;lan went to take a walk. As soon as he arrived at the ocean he wondered how he could get across.
Not long after he put his headaxe on the water and he rode on it, for he used magic, and his headaxe floated and went to the
other side of the ocean. As soon as he reached the other side he took a walk and he saw the big golden house in the middle
of the wide plain. He was surprised, and he went to see it, and the crocodiles all slept while he crossed the ocean. When
he reached the spring he said, &#8220;How pretty the well is. I think the girl who owns this well has magical power, and that she
is pretty also.&#8221; So he went to the house and said, &#8220;Good afternoon.&#8221; Alama-an was cooking, and she said, &#8220;Good afternoon.&#8221;
She looked at him from the window, and she saw that he was a fine looking man. She did not tell Apon&#299;bolinayen, but she had
him go up the ladder. The old woman who took care of them asked why she did not tell her and Apon&#299;bolinayen. Alama-an said
she did not know what she was doing when she had him go up. So the old woman went to ask him what he came for. He said, &#8220;I
just took a walk and I did not know how to get home, for there was a very high bank in the way, so I came across the ocean
to learn the other way back home. While I was still on the ocean I saw this big golden house. I came here, for I was very
tired, for it is more than one month since I left Kabilab&#299;lan.&#8221; &#8220;Ala, you Alama-an go and cook some food for this young man,&#8221;
said the old woman, and Alama-an went truly, and when she finished cooking, the old woman called him to eat. The young man
said he did not wish to eat unless one of the ladies who never went outdoors<a id="d0e3653src" href="#d0e3653" class="noteref">110</a> ate with him. &#8220;Alama-an is the girl who never goes outdoors,&#8221; <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3659"></a>Page 85</span>said the old woman, but he did not believe her, and so he did not go. When he would not eat she called Sinogyaman to go and
eat, but the young man said, &#8220;I do not wish to eat with anyone except the pretty girl who never goes outdoors.&#8221; So the old
woman called Indi&aacute;pan. As soon as she went outdoors to the place where the young man was, &#8220;No, that is not the girl I want.
There is one prettier still. I will not go to eat.&#8221; The old woman became angry and said, &#8220;If you are not hungry and do not
wish to eat that is all right. I have offered three young girls to eat with you, but if you do not wish to eat with them I
do not care.&#8221; When the old woman and the three girls had eaten they gave him a place to sleep, and they slept also.

</p>
<p id="d0e3661">While the others were talking to the young man, Apon&#299;bolinayen was looking through a crack of the house, and she liked him
very much. She wished to go outdoors and talk to him, but she was afraid because the old woman had said there were only the
three young girls whom she called. As soon as they had finished talking, they went to bed.

</p>
<p id="d0e3663">In the middle of the night Ingiwan said to himself, &#8220;I believe there are other young girls here prettier than the last one
she showed me. I will use my power and will become a firefly, and I will fly to all parts of the house, and see if there is
a prettier one there.&#8221; So he used his power and he became a firefly and he flew.<a id="d0e3665src" href="#d0e3665" class="noteref">111</a> When he was in the room where the old woman was, he left, and went where Alama-an was, and he went on to Sinogyaman. When
he did not like her he went to Indi&aacute;pan. &#8220;This is the last girl she showed me and I like her, but I believe that there is
another prettier.&#8221; So he went to the next room, but no one slept there, and so he went on to the ninth room. He heard the
sound of the pan pipe in the ninth room, and he was very glad. He flew over the head of the woman who was playing, and she
stopped playing and struck at him. &#8220;How did the firefly get in here? I do not think there are any cracks in here.&#8221; The firefly
said, &#8220;Do not strike at me, for I fear you will hit my headaxe and be cut.&#8221; So he became a man and sat down beside her, and
Apon&#299;bolinayen saw that it was the man who had talked with the old woman and the girls, and she loved him, but she said, &#8220;Go
outdoors, do not come here. I am afraid that the old woman who cares for us will see us. If you want something wait until
morning and we will talk with her.&#8221; Ingiwan did not get up and he would not go outdoors, and he said, &#8220;The best thing for
us to do is to chew betel-nut, so we will know each other. Do not be afraid for I would not have come here if it was not my
fortune to marry you, for I was taking a walk and intended to go back home, but I met a high bank in the way, and there was
no <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3671"></a>Page 86</span>place to go except the ocean, so I came across the ocean. As soon as I reached the field I saw your house and I was surprised
to see the golden house in the middle of the field. I spoke to the young girl who was cooking and she asked me to come up,
and the old woman hated her. They asked me to eat, but I would not unless a pretty girl ate with me. So the old woman called
two other pretty girls, but I did not want them, for they are not so pretty as you. I thought there were others prettier than
the last one she showed me, so I became a firefly. It is my fortune to marry you.&#8221; So he cut the betel-nut, but Apon&#299;bolinayen
did not want to chew. When he talked to her so she could not sleep she took the betel-nut, and when they chewed they saw that
they both had magical power and that it was good for them to marry. Ingiwan said, &#8220;You are the woman who lives here and you
must tell your name first.&#8221; &#8220;No, it is not good for a woman to tell her name first. You tell your name.&#8221; Not long after, &#8220;My
name is Ingiwan, the son of <i>alan</i>, of Kabilab&#299;lan, who did not find a way to go home, but who found you.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;bolinayen, who is the sister of
Apon&#299;balagen of Natpangan, who put me here so no one might see me. It is bad that you have come.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3676">When the daylight came Alama-an went to cook and when she finished the old woman said to her, &#8220;Go and call the man and see
if he wishes to eat with the girls. You call them, but do not call Apon&#299;bolinayen, for that is why we are here, so no one
can see her. I do not know why the alligators did not see him.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen and Ingiwan heard what she said and they laughed.
So Alama-an went to call him, but he was not in the room. She went to tell the old woman that he was not there, and they were
surprised, for they thought he had gone home, for all the other rooms were locked. &#8220;If he is not there you go and call Apon&#299;bolinayen
and we will eat.&#8221; The three girls went to the room of Apon&#299;bolinayen, but Ingiwan disappeared and they only saw Apon&#299;bolinayen.
So they all went to eat and Ingiwan was not hungry, for Apon&#299;bolinayen used magic, so that rice and meat went to where he
was hiding.

</p>
<p id="d0e3678">When they had lived together a long time Apon&#299;bolinayen said to him, &#8220;You better go home now, for it is time for my brother
to visit us. If you wish to marry me you must arrange with him and my father.&#8221; So Ingiwan went back home and the crocodiles
only watched him, but did not try to eat him. He rode on his headaxe, and when he reached the other side of the ocean he saw
that the high bank had disappeared and he found the way home.

</p>
<p id="d0e3680">Not long after Apon&#299;balagen went to wash his hair, and he went to the place where Apon&#299;bolinayen and the other girls were
living. The three girls and the old woman agreed not to tell that a man had been <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3682"></a>Page 87</span>there. As soon as Apon&#299;balagen arrived in Kabwa-an he asked the old woman if anyone had been there, and she replied, &#8220;No.&#8221;
He called Alama-an and the other girls to the place where Apon&#299;bolinayen was, so all of them might louse him. While Apon&#299;bolinayen
was lousing her brother the milk from her breasts dropped on his legs, and Apon&#299;balagen was surprised, and he said, &#8220;What
have you done, Apon&#299;bolinayen.&#8221; She tried to rub it off from his leg. &#8220;No, do not rub it off; what is that?&#8221; &#8220;I do not know,
brother. I guess I am sweating, for I am hot.&#8221; &#8220;No, I do not believe you, I think someone has been here.&#8221; He called the old
woman and asked her. &#8220;You, grandmother, did you see a man who came here? Do not tell a lie.&#8221; &#8220;Why?&#8221; asked the old woman. But
she knew that Apon&#299;bolinayen had a little baby, for she had pricked her little finger and the baby had come out.<a id="d0e3684src" href="#d0e3684" class="noteref">112</a> &#8220;When the girls were lousing me the milk from Apon&#299;bolinayen's breast dropped on my legs. I think you know the man who has
been here.&#8221; &#8220;I do not believe anyone came here, for we are on this side of the ocean, and the crocodiles protect us.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3690">Apon&#299;balagen called all the crocodiles to the side of the house, and he whipped all the crocodiles, and he asked them why
they did not eat the man who went to Kabwa-an. As soon as he whipped them one of them said, &#8220;We did not see any man come here,
but we were all very sleepy one day a long time ago. We would have eaten the man if we had seen him.&#8221; Apon&#299;balagen whipped
all of them again. &#8220;I put you here to prevent anyone from coming here, and you did not watch. Go away.&#8221; The crocodiles were afraid and they said,
&#8220;If that is what you say we will go.&#8221; So they went. Apon&#299;balagen went back to the house and whipped the girls. &#8220;We will go
back now to Kaodanan. I thought it was good for you to be here, but you have done wrong.&#8221; So he took them back to Kaodanan
and they made <i>balaua</i> in order to find out who was the father of the boy. The boy grew one span every time they bathed him,<a id="d0e3698src" href="#d0e3698" class="noteref">113</a> for they used their power. In a few days they built their <i>balaua</i> and the <i>liblibayan</i><a id="d0e3709src" href="#d0e3709" class="noteref">114</a> got betel-nuts which were covered with gold, and they oiled them and sent them to invite the people in all parts of the world.
So the betel-nuts went.

</p>
<p id="d0e3715">As soon as the betel-nuts arrived in Kabilab&#299;lan, they said, &#8220;Good morning, Kagkag&aacute;kag,&#8221;<a id="d0e3717src" href="#d0e3717" class="noteref">115</a> to the man who was lying in his <i>balaua</i> covered with mud. &#8220;We came to invite you to the <i>balaua</i> of Apon&#299;balagen.&#8221; &#8220;I do not wish to go, for I have no clothes and am ashamed. I do not know <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3726"></a>Page 88</span>the man who is going to make <i>balaua</i>.&#8221; &#8220;If you do not go I will grow on your knee,&#8221; said one of the betel-nuts. &#8220;Do as you wish.&#8221; So the betel-nut grew on his
knee. When it grew big he became tired and he said, &#8220;Get off from me now and I will go.&#8221; So they went. All the people from
the other towns had arrived and Apon&#299;balagen carried the baby, to see whom the baby would want to go to, but the baby did
not want any of them. When the betel-nut and Kagkag&aacute;kag appeared the baby was happy and wanted to go to him. So Apon&#299;balagen
gave the boy to him and all the people were surprised that Apon&#299;bolinayen had wanted him. Not long after they danced, and
when they had finished Apon&#299;balagen said to Apon&#299;bolinayen, &#8220;Take off all your things and go to Kagkag&aacute;kag.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen
did not wish to go, for he was not the same man she was with before, but her brother made her go, and he said, &#8220;Kagkag&aacute;kag,
take her to your town.&#8221; So he took her to his town, and when they reached the gate Apon&#299;bolinayen was crying, but he said
to her, &#8220;Do not feel bad, I am the man who came to Kabwa-an. That is why the boy wants me, for I am his father.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen
did not believe him, but when they arrived at the spring of Kabilab&#299;lan she was surprised to see that the stones were of gold,
and the fruits of the trees were of gold and were beads, and she said to Kagkag&aacute;kag, &#8220;Why do we come here? It is shameful
for us to be seen by the man who owns this.&#8221; Kagkag&aacute;kag laughed at her. &#8220;If you do not believe that I am your husband, you
watch.&#8221; And he went to take a bath, and the mud all washed off, and she saw that he was the man who was with her before in
Kabwa-an. So they went up to the town, and the <i>alan</i> who cared for Ingiwan was glad to see them.

</p>
<p id="d0e3734">Not long after they made <i>balaua</i>, for they wished to call Apon&#299;balagen so that he would not always feel badly about them. Not long after they sent the betel-nuts
to summon their relatives. As soon as the betel-nut arrived in Kaodanan, &#8220;Good afternoon, Apon&#299;bolinayen and Kagkag&aacute;kag want
you to attend their <i>Sayang</i>.&#8221; Apon&#299;balagen laughed and said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and he called all the people and told them to prepare to go to the <i>balaua</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e3745">When they arrived at the spring everyone was astonished, for all the fruit of the trees was of gold, and all the places they
walked were covered with plates. And Apon&#299;balagen said, &#8220;I do not think this is the spring of Kagkag&aacute;kag. I think someone
else owns it. We will go up to the house where he lives.&#8221; When they reached the gate of the town they asked the young girl
who was going to the spring where Apon&#299;bolinayen and Kagkag&aacute;kag slept, and the woman said, &#8220;You follow these plates, for they
go to the ladder of Kagkag&aacute;kag's house.&#8221; So they went and they always walked on the plates. When they arrived they saw many
people <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3747"></a>Page 89</span>dancing in the yard and Apon&#299;balagen shook their hands. &#8220;Kagkag&aacute;kag, if you had come as you are now to my <i>balaua</i> I would not have been bad to my sister.&#8221; Kagkag&aacute;kag laughed at them and they all chewed betel-nut.

</p>
<p id="d0e3752">While they were chewing Langa-an and Pagatip&aacute;nan went to them and they said, &#8220;We came to chew betel-nut also to see if we
are related to you.&#8221; Kagkag&aacute;kag gave them betel-nut, and when they chewed they found out that they were relatives and they
called Kagkag&aacute;kag, Apon&#299;tolau, and he paid the marriage price for Apon&#299;bolinayen. Apon&#299;gawan&#299; said to him, &#8220;I thought I had
no brother. I do not know what my father and mother did with you.&#8221; The <i>alan</i> who cared for Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;He was by the road where Langa-an had dropped him on her way to Nagbotobot&aacute;n, so I picked
him up, for I have no children.&#8221; As soon as Apon&#299;tolau paid the marriage price they danced again, and the <i>alan</i> gave all her things to Apon&#299;tolau, for Langa-an and Pagatip&aacute;nan took them home. Not long after Apon&#299;balagen married Apon&#299;gawan&#299;,
and he paid the same as Apon&#299;tolau had paid for Apon&#299;bolinayen.

</p>
<p id="d0e3760">(Told by Madomar, a woman of Riang barrio Patok.)

</p><a id="d0e3762"></a><h2>11</h2>
<p id="d0e3765">&#8220;I go to visit my cousin Gawigawen of Adasin,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. He pushed his raft until he reached Pangasinan. At the spring
he asked the women if his cousin Apon&#299;bolinayen was there. &#8220;She is not, because she went to celebrate <i>Sayang.</i><a id="d0e3769src" href="#d0e3769" class="noteref">116</a> Did you not get the invitation of Gawigawen of Adasin?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau.

</p>
<p id="d0e3775">Apon&#299;bolinayen went to have Lisnaya fix her upper arm beads and they sat in the shade of the <i>pamlo-ongen</i> tree, and Apon&#299;bolinayen dropped her switch.

</p>
<p id="d0e3780">&#8220;I wish to visit my relatives, but am ashamed because the invitation did not reach me,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. So he went to rest
in the shade of the <i>pamlo-ongen</i> tree, and he saw there the switch which was spread out, and there was none like it.

</p>
<p id="d0e3785">The women who had been at the spring said, &#8220;Why did you not invite Apon&#299;tolau? Whenever we have trouble, it is he and his
cousin that we call.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3787">&#8220;Ala, we go down to the river to see.&#8221; They went to get Apon&#299;tolau and when they arrived at the spring he was there in the
shade of the tree. &#8220;Ala, forgive us because the invitation did not reach you and come up to the <i>Sayang</i>&#8221; &#8220;Yes, but if the old enemy is there, when I go, the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3792"></a>Page 90</span>dance circle will be disturbed, if we fight.&#8221; They still requested him, and he went up to the place where they danced during
the two months.

</p>
<p id="d0e3794">Dalinmanok of Dalinap&#333;yan said, &#8220;Long ago, when my grandfather was young, the town of Kadalayapan became wooded.&#8221; (He meant
that his grandfather had destroyed the town in which Apon&#299;tolau's ancestors lived.) &#8220;My grandfather Dagol&aacute;yen long ago said,
&#8216;Dalinap&oacute;yan, Dagala, and also Dagopan became wooded.&#8217;&#8221; Then Dalinmanok became angry; he looked like a courting cock and seized Apon&#299;tolau by the hair. &#8220;It is as I predicted, Cousin
Gawigawen; the circle is now broken.&#8221; They parted the fighters, but the hawk hastened to the town of Kadalayapan to tell Apon&#299;gawan&#299;.


</p>
<p id="d0e3799">&#8220;Cousin Dumal&aacute;gan, Cousin Agyokan; the enemy&#8212;the old one&#8212;has killed my brother Apon&#299;tolau at the <i>Sayang</i> of Gawigawen of Adasin, so says the hawk.&#8221; After that they started and soon arrived in Adasin. They began at the south end
of the town and killed so many it looked as though they were cutting down banana trees. &#8220;Look down, Apon&#299;tolau, and see if
you know the men who are destroying the town.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau truly looked. &#8220;Why, Cousin Dumal&aacute;gan and Cousin Agyokan, do you
destroy the town?&#8221; &#8220;Because the hawk reported to Apon&#299;gawan&#299; that you had been killed by the old enemy in the town of Adasin,
and she has thrown away her upper arm beads<a id="d0e3804src" href="#d0e3804" class="noteref">117</a> by the gate of Kadalayapan.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3807">&#8220;Ala! you stop. Ala! You who live, join their heads and their bodies; you join all,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I will spit once and they will
appear as if they were not cut at all. I will whip my perfume which is <i>banow&#7431;s</i>, they quickly breathe. I whip my perfume which is <i>alikadakad</i> (clatter), and they quickly stand up. I whip my perfume which is <i>dagimonau (monau</i>&#8212;just awakened) and they quickly recover.&#8221;<a id="d0e3818src" href="#d0e3818" class="noteref">118</a> &#8220;Oh, how long we have slept,&#8221; they said. &#8220;How long we have slept, you say, and you have been dead.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, how powerful are
the people of Kadalayapan! Even if we die, we may hope to live again at once,&#8221; they said, and all went up to the house of
Gawigawen.

</p>
<p id="d0e3824">&#8220;Now Dalinmanok of Dalinap&#333;yan, Dumpoga of Dagala, L&#299;g&#299; of Madag&#299;tan and L&#299;g&#299; of Dagopan, expect me in two months' time, for
I shall come to fight you.&#8221; After that they agreed and everybody went home. When they arrived at Kadalayapan there were no
upper arm beads on Apon&#299;gawan&#299;, for she believed the hawk when it told her Apon&#299;tolau was dead. &#8220;No, I am not dead, but when
two months have passed I shall go to fight Dalinmanok and his companions.&#8221;
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3826"></a>Page 91</span></p>
<p id="d0e3827">&#8220;When you went to sail, did you not find the switch which belongs to Apon&#299;bolinayen? They are now making a ceremony to find
it.&#8221; &#8220;It is here, that which I picked up in the shade of the <i>pamlo-ongen</i> tree, and I will take it back when I go to fight.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3832">Not long after that, according to the custom of the story, the second month came. &#8220;Old men who know the signs and very old
women, come and see the liver and gall sack, because I go to fight.&#8221; After that they all gathered, they caught the pig and
cut it in large pieces. &#8220;Ala, old men who know the signs and very old women, come and see the gall, for I go to fight.&#8221;<a id="d0e3834src" href="#d0e3834" class="noteref">119</a> &#8220;This is better than your grandfather had when he consulted the gall. How fearful you will be to the town which you go to
fight!&#8221; &#8220;Cousin Agyokan, go and tell all our cousins that we start when morning comes.&#8221; When early morning came&#8212;as goes in
a story&#8212;they arrived. Apon&#299;tolau played his Jew's harp at the spring of the town, and it sounded like the song of a bird and
the people smelt the odor of <i>alangigan</i> (<i>Ilangilang</i>) which is only possessed by the people of Kadalayapan. &#8220;Ala, it is Apon&#299;tolau,&#8221; said Dalinmanok. &#8220;Go and tell our companions
that we go to fight him at the river, for we do not wish them to come on shore in our town.&#8221; When it was day, they met at
the river and they fought until afternoon; and when Apon&#299;tolau was thirsty his headaxe turned slantwise and water blue as
indigo flowed off it freely.

</p>
<p id="d0e3846">&#8220;Dumpoga of Dagala, L&#299;g&#299; of Madag&#299;tan, L&#299;g&#299; of Dagopan, Masilnag of Kaskasilnagan, I come to teach you because you do not
know how to kill. When one tries to kill your left side, receive the blow with your right, and when they try to kill the right
side, receive it with the left. Ala! you that are left alive, it is better that I spare you and that you marry the wives of
your companions. I will spare you if you will all agree to give me one hundred jars which are <i>ginlasan, summadag</i>, and <i>tadogan</i>.&#8221; They agreed. They rolled the jars which they took down to the river and there were among them <i>doldol&#299;</i> and <i>ginaang</i>,<a id="d0e3860src" href="#d0e3860" class="noteref">120</a> and the jars were glad, for they had formerly belonged to Dagol&aacute;yen, the grandfather of Apon&#299;tolau, but had been stolen.
After that Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;Give me your betel-nut with magic power. You jars and all you heads of dead persons which are
cut off, go first to Kadalayapan.&#8221; After that they went and Apon&#299;tolau followed. After they arrived they danced with the heads
and in a short time put them on the <i>sagang.</i><a id="d0e3868src" href="#d0e3868" class="noteref">121</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e3874">&#8220;Now, Apon&#299;gawan&#299;, bring me the switch of Apon&#299;bolinayen, for I <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3876"></a>Page 92</span>go to take it to her.&#8221; He took the switch and used the power of the betel-nut, so that he went as quickly as a person can
point to the place of many betel-nuts. In a short time, as the story goes, they arrived. &#8220;Good evening,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau,
but Apon&#299;bolinayen thought him to be an enemy. &#8220;Does the old enemy bring greetings?&#8221; asked Apon&#299;tolau. Then they went up into
the house and he leaned against the corner pole. Apon&#299;bolinayen looked at Apon&#299;tolau and his good looks seemed to climb the
corner pole. &#8220;It is better for us to tell our names,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau, &#8220;for it is difficult to talk when we do not know each
other's names.&#8221; After that he took out, from his little sack, nuts whose husks were of gold. He cut a nut and when he gave
the half to Apon&#299;bolinayen their golden finger rings exchanged themselves. &#8220;Give back my ring,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our relationship
is the reason they change,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. Then they chewed and laid the quids on the headaxe and they became agate beads
which looked like honey, and laid in parallel lines. &#8220;We are relatives,&#8221; they said, and in a short time they told their names.
When it became time to eat, Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;What do we eat?&#8221; He took the boiling stick and broke it into pieces, and
it became a fish which they ate,<a id="d0e3878src" href="#d0e3878" class="noteref">122</a> and Apon&#299;tolau took the bone out of the fish which Apon&#299;bolinayen ate. When they finished eating she spread the mat and the
blanket which they kept in the box. &#8220;I do not like a blanket which is kept in a box, for it smells like <i>kimi</i>,&#8221;<a id="d0e3887src" href="#d0e3887" class="noteref">123</a> said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;Why do you not like it? It is what we keep for company and is easy to use,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;The end
of my clout is enough for my blanket,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. Then Apon&#299;bolinayen used the power of the betel-nut and vanished.
&#8220;Why is there no one here?&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;I use your power betel-nut, so that I may become the insect which belongs to
Kaodanan (i.e., the firefly).&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3890">After that he flew and arrived in the ninth room and sailed back and forth near Apon&#299;bolinayen who was playing a pan-pipe.
He touched her body and she struck him away. &#8220;You must not strike me away, for you hit my headaxe.&#8221; After that Apon&#299;tolau
sat down. &#8220;How did you pass in here?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I passed through the crack in the wall,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau; and after that
they laid together. When it was early morning Apon&#299;bolinayen sent him away, for she feared her brother might come.

</p>
<p id="d0e3892">As Apon&#299;tolau went quickly to his raft, he was seen by Balau of Baboyan, a great bird. &#8220;How fine is Apon&#299;tolau, Ala! I shall
take <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3894"></a>Page 93</span>him to marry Gint&#7431;ban.&#8221;<a id="d0e3896src" href="#d0e3896" class="noteref">124</a> Then he was seized by Balau and was carried to Baboyan. &#8220;Now Apon&#299;tolau, you must marry Gint&#7431;ban who lived in Baygan, for
this place is surrounded with water blue as indigo and many crocodiles lie in that water.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3899">In a little while, as the story goes, Apon&#299;bolinayen gave birth to a child.

</p>
<p id="d0e3901">&#8220;Ala! grandmother, prick my little finger, for it itches.&#8221; She truly opened it and the baby popped out like popped rice.<a id="d0e3903src" href="#d0e3903" class="noteref">125</a> After that they bathed it and called him Balokanag, for that is a name of the people of Kadalayapan. Soon the child was large
and asked for a clout, then he asked the name of his father, but they told him falsely that it was Dumanagan. &#8220;Ala! get me
a top so that I can play with the others,&#8221; he said. Then his mother gave him the top which was his father's when he was a
little boy. After that he went to play with it. When it was late afternoon, the old woman Alokot&aacute;n went to feed the pigs,
but Kanag threw his top and it broke her jar. &#8220;Pa-ya,&#8221; said the old woman, &#8220;the son is brave; when you go to rescue your father
who Balau captured, it will not be my pot toward which you act brave.&#8221; Kanag cried, &#8220;You said, mother, that Dumanagan is my
father, but there is another who is my father&#8212;Apon&#299;tolau whom Balau stole.&#8221; Then Apon&#299;bolinayen cried, &#8220;How bad you are, old
woman! We should have exchanged for your jar if you had not told him of his father.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3909">&#8220;You must make me sweets, for I go to get my father,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If he was seized, you who are little will be also,&#8221; said his
mother, but he insisted. Then she used magic and secured for him the headaxe used by his father when he was a little boy,
and she made him sweets. He started and went, and his mother planted a <i>lawed</i> vine by their hearth.<a id="d0e3914src" href="#d0e3914" class="noteref">126</a> &#8220;Your power betel-nut, so that I go as quickly as pointing to Baboyan,&#8221; said Kanag. Soon he arrived there, and he saw the
crocodiles lying in the water. &#8220;You power betel-nut that I may walk on the crocodiles. Make them all sleep so that they do
not feel me.&#8221; He reached the home of Balau, where he saw great snakes hanging in the trees. He climbed the trees, he cut them
so that they fell down, he cast them down&#8212;those big snakes&#8212;then he cut off the head of Balau, and the earth trembled. After
that he went to find his father who was in the place of many betel-nuts.

</p>
<p id="d0e3920">&#8220;I am Balokanag whom Apon&#299;bolinayen desired, whom you left,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now I take you home to Kadalayapan.&#8221; After that he
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3922"></a>Page 94</span>truly took home Apon&#299;tolau, and Gint&#7431;ban, who lived in Baygan. In a short time they arrived in Kadalayapan and Kanag's mother
was there, because Apon&#299;gawan&#299; had taken her home. &#8220;Now we are married forever, Apon&#299;tolau,&#8221; said Gint&#7431;ban who lived in Baygan.
&#8220;No, for Apon&#299;bolinayen is his wife,&#8221; replied Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. &#8220;Ala! you chance it and the one who loses is not the one who is
married. Put clay dishes in line, which you are to step on. The one who breaks them loses.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen stepped first and
there was nothing broken. Gint&#7431;ban followed and all those clay dishes which she stepped on were broken. Then she went home
to Baygan and after that Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen were married.

<p id="d0e3927">&#8220;I am anxious to eat the fruit of the <i>bolnay</i> tree<a id="d0e3932src" href="#d0e3932" class="noteref">127</a> of Mataw&#299;t&aacute;wen,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;What is that?&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;. &#8220;I am anxious to eat fish roe, I said.&#8221; &#8220;Bring me a fish
net and I will go and get some,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;. So she went to get the fish net and gave it to him. Not long after he went to
the river and he used magic so that all the fish in the river were caught, so truly all the fish were in the net. He caught
one of them and cut it open and took out the roe. As soon as he secured the roe he let the fish all go out of the net and
he went back home. Not long after he reached the yard of their house. &#8220;Apon&#299;bolinayen, come and get the fish roe which you
desire,&#8221; he said. She went to get it from him. She did not cook it, but put it on the bamboo hanger above the fire. L&#299;g&#299; went
to the <i>balaua</i> and when Apon&#299;bolinayen thought he was in the <i>balaua</i> she threw away the roe and the dogs went to eat it, and they snarled and barked beneath the kitchen. &#8220;What are the dogs fighting
about, Apon&#299;bolinayen? I think you threw away the fish roe,&#8221; he said to her. &#8220;I dropped one of them.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e3941">Apon&#299;bolinayen went again to the room and she said again that she wished to eat the fruit of Mataw&#299;t&aacute;wen, and L&#299;g&#299; asked what
she said. &#8220;I am anxious for the liver of a deer, I said.&#8221; So L&#299;g&#299; went to the woods to hunt deer. As soon as he reached the
woods he sent his dogs and he said to them, &#8220;You, my black dog, do not catch deer except in the low grass, and you, my striped
dog, do not touch any deer unless they have large horns.&#8221; Not long after his dogs caught some deer, and he took their livers
and he let them go again. Not long after he arrived at his house and he called Apon&#299;bolinayen, &#8220;Come and get the liver, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3943"></a>Page 95</span>which you wish to eat.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen said to him, &#8220;Put it in the rattan hanger.&#8221; L&#299;g&#299; went back to the <i>balaua</i>, and Apon&#299;bolinayen used magic so that L&#299;g&#299; slept. While he was asleep she went to the kitchen to throw away the livers of
the deer, and the dogs went to eat and made such a great disturbance that L&#299;g&#299; awoke and asked Apon&#299;bolinayen what was the
matter. &#8220;One small piece of liver which I did not eat.&#8221; She went again to the room and laid down, and L&#299;g&#299; used magic and
became an ant, and he went to the crack of the floor, for he wanted to know what Apon&#299;bolinayen was saying, for he suspected
that she was not telling him the truth. As soon as he arrived in the crack Apon&#299;bolinayen repeated her wish to eat the <i>bolnay</i> fruit of Mataw&#299;t&aacute;wen, and L&#299;g&#299; became a man again and appeared to her. &#8220;Why did you not tell the truth, Apon&#299;bolinayen?&#8221;
he said and she answered, &#8220;I did not, because Mataw&#299;t&aacute;wen is very far and I am afraid that you will be lost.&#8221; &#8220;No, give me
a sack,&#8221; he said to her. So he went and he used magic so that he arrived at the tree at once.

</p>
<p id="d0e3951">Not long after he arrived truly at the place and he secured the fruit and put it in the sack. As soon as the sack was filled
he took some of the fruit to hold in his other hand and he went. Not long after he reached the spring in Kadalayapan and his
sweethearts were at the spring. &#8220;L&#299;g&#299;, how many and how pretty the <i>bolnay</i> fruit are. Your sack is filled and you have some in your hands. Will you give us some of it to eat?&#8221; So L&#299;g&#299; gave them all
the fruit in the sack and all he held in his hand. &#8220;Do not give everything to Apon&#299;bolinayen, but give to us also.&#8221; So he
gave them all he had. &#8220;The baby inside of Apon&#299;bolinayen, which desires the <i>bolnay</i>, is not your child, but is the child of Ma&#333;b&aacute;gan,&#8221; said his sweethearts, and when they had eaten all of the fruit L&#299;g&#299; went
home with nothing but the sack. He gave the sack to Apon&#299;bolinayen. As soon as she received it she looked to see what was
inside and she found one little piece of the fruit which the women had overlooked, and she ate it. As soon as she ate it:
&#8220;I am anxious to eat more if there are more. My headache is gone.&#8221; &#8220;What is that?&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;, angrily. &#8220;You get ready for
I will put you in the place where the tree is if you want more.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen said to him, &#8220;Because I said that I wanted
more you want to put me by the tree.&#8221; L&#299;g&#299; was angry and he seized her by the arm and dragged her to the tree. As soon as
they arrived at the <i>bolnay</i> tree, he dug a hole about neck deep and he put her in it. As soon as he put her in the hole he went back home.

</p>
<p id="d0e3962">Soon Apon&#299;bolinayen was ready to give birth. &#8220;What can I do?&#8221; she said to the spirit Ayo. Ayo said, &#8220;The best thing for us
to do is to prick your little finger.&#8221; Not long after the little baby popped out of <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e3964"></a>Page 96</span>her finger.<a id="d0e3967src" href="#d0e3967" class="noteref">128</a> &#8220;What shall we call him?&#8221; they said. &#8220;We will call him Kanag, for it is the name of the people who live in Kadalayapan.&#8221;
Every time they gave him a bath the baby always grew, for they used magic.<a id="d0e3973src" href="#d0e3973" class="noteref">129</a> Not long after the baby became a boy, and he wanted them to get out of the hole. &#8220;No, we do not get out, for I am afraid
your father is watching us.&#8221; The little boy got out even though his mother was afraid.

</p>
<p id="d0e3979">As soon as the boy got out of the hole he listened to hear where many children were playing. So he walked to where the sounds
came from. As soon as he arrived at the place where the boys were swimming Dagol&aacute;yan saw him. &#8220;Who is that boy?&#8221; he said to
his companions, and the little boy went near to them. &#8220;Why, this boy looks like my uncle in Kadalayapan,&#8221; said Dagol&aacute;yan to
his companions, and he asked him who his father was, and the boy said he was the son of an <i>alan</i> of Mataw&#299;t&aacute;wen. Not long after they agreed that they would go to fight. So Kanag agreed with them and they decided on a day
and Dagol&aacute;yan told him that he would go to his home. &#8220;If that is what you say, it is all right,&#8221; said Kanag, and they all
went home. As soon as he arrived at the hole by the <i>bolnay</i> tree: &#8220;Why, we are cousins,&#8221; said the other boy to me. And Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;Perhaps it is the boy from Kaodanan.&#8221; &#8220;We
agreed to go to fight, day after tomorrow. Make cakes for me to take with me.&#8221; &#8220;No, do not go, for I fear that your father
will meet you.&#8221; &#8220;No, I am going. I will plant the <i>lawed</i> vine by the stove, and if it wilts I am dead,&#8221;<a id="d0e3990src" href="#d0e3990" class="noteref">130</a> he said.

</p>
<p id="d0e3999">Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen went to make cakes for his provisions, and Dagol&aacute;yan started early in the morning to go to see
Kanag, and it seemed as if a thousand men struck their shields. Kanag heard the sound of the shield. &#8220;Who are the boys with
Dagol&aacute;yan who go with us to fight?&#8221; As soon as Kanag met Dagol&aacute;yan they went, and they both struck their shields, and L&#299;g&#299;
heard them and he was surprised for it sounded like two thousand people. So L&#299;g&#299; thought that Dagol&aacute;yan had many companions.
As soon as they arrived where L&#299;g&#299; was waiting for them, &#8220;Where did you get the other boy who is with you?&#8221; he said to Dagol&aacute;yan.
He answered that he met him where they were swimming, and that they agreed to go to fight together. L&#299;g&#299; wanted to kill him,
and he said, &#8220;I want to kill.&#8221; &#8220;No, do not kill him,&#8221; said Dagol&aacute;yan. <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4001"></a>Page 97</span>Not long after they went. As soon as they arrived where there were no houses, Kanag used his power so that it rained very
hard and they had nothing to cook. Not long after it rained and L&#299;g&#299; and Dagol&aacute;yan did not cook anything, for everything was
damp. The spirit helpers of Apon&#299;bolinayen always fed Kanag, and L&#299;g&#299; and Dagol&aacute;yan ate with him. &#8220;What is the matter of this
boy who is the son of <i>alan</i>? He has something to eat. I do not believe that his mother <i>alan</i> knows how to prepare good food,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;, angrily.

</p>
<p id="d0e4009">After they had finished eating they went, and after a while they wished to fight. &#8220;The best for us to do is to stand in different
places and ambush the people,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;. &#8220;The best for you, son of <i>alan</i>, is to stay at the place where the carabao pass by.&#8221; And L&#299;g&#299; went to hide where the people passed by on the way to the spring,
and Dagol&aacute;yan staid on the other side. A young pretty girl passed by the place where Kanag was hiding, so he cut off her head
and he shouted, for he was very happy. &#8220;Why did the son of <i>alan</i> kill someone before us?&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;. Not long after an old woman and an old man passed by where L&#299;g&#299; and Dagol&aacute;yan were hiding,
and they killed them. Not long after they saw the head which Kanag had taken, and Kanag saw the heads which L&#299;g&#299; and Dagol&aacute;yan
had taken were those of an old man and old woman. Dagol&aacute;yan said to him, &#8220;What did you say when you killed that pretty girl?
I think I heard you say, &#8216;Your father does not like you.&#8217; I did not hear very well so I ask for sure.&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;The son of <i>alan</i> of Mataw&#299;t&aacute;wen kills the pretty girl is what I said.&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;No, that is not what you said. You said you were the son of a man
who lives in Kadalayapan.&#8221; Not long after, when Dagol&aacute;yan could not make Kanag repeat what he had said, they all went back
to Kadalayapan where L&#299;g&#299; lived.

</p>
<p id="d0e4020">When they arrived in Kadalayapan they played the <i>gansa</i> and danced, and Apon&#299;bolinayen heard the sound of the <i>gansa</i>, and she was anxious to go, but her spirit companion would not let her go. They saw that the <i>lawed</i> vine was green. Not long after they made Kanag dance, and when his body trembled, while he danced, the whole town of Kadalayapan
trembled also; and when he moved his feet the fish were around his feet and they went to lap his feet, because the water came
up into the town. When he stamped his feet the coconuts fell from the trees, and L&#299;g&#299; was very angry, and he went to sharpen
his headaxe. As soon as he had sharpened his headaxe he went to where Kanag was dancing and he cut off his head. When Apon&#299;bolinayen
looked at the <i>lawed</i> vine each leaf was wilted. &#8220;Grandmother, the <i>lawed</i> vine which Kanag planted is wilted,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;I am going to get him.&#8221; So she went and as she approached the
place where L&#299;g&#299; used to <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4037"></a>Page 98</span>live he saw her. &#8220;How angry you were, L&#299;g&#299;; you killed your son,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen, and L&#299;g&#299; bent his head, for he did
not know it was his son. &#8220;I will use magic so that when I whip my perfume <i>alikadakad</i> he will stand up.&#8221;<a id="d0e4042src" href="#d0e4042" class="noteref">131</a> So the little boy stood up at once. Not long after she used her power again, and whipped her perfume <i>dagimonau</i> so that her son awoke. He woke up and said, &#8220;How long my sleep is!&#8221; &#8220;No, do not say that; your father killed you.&#8221; She wanted
to take him back to Mataw&#299;t&aacute;wen, but L&#299;g&#299; prevented them and he begged them to forgive him, and Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;No,
we will go back, for you did not want us and you put us there.&#8221; So they went to Mataw&#299;t&aacute;wen and L&#299;g&#299; followed them. As soon
as they arrived at the spring of Mataw&#299;t&aacute;wen Apon&#299;bolinayen used her power. &#8220;I use my power so that L&#299;g&#299; cannot see us, and
the trail will become filled with thorns.&#8221;<a id="d0e4051src" href="#d0e4051" class="noteref">132</a> Not long after L&#299;g&#299; could not walk in the trail and he could not see them, and he was very sorry. He laid down, because he
could not follow them and his hair grew like vines along the ground; and he did not eat, for he was always sorry about the
things he had done to his wife and son. Not long after they forgave him and went to get him, and they all went back to Kadalayapan.
L&#299;g&#299; commanded his spirit attendants to take his sweethearts and kill them, for they told falsehoods about Apon&#299;bolinayen,
so that he did not want her any more. This is all.

<p id="d0e4057">(Told by Magwati of Lagangilang.)

</p><a id="d0e4059"></a><h2>13</h2>
<p id="d0e4062">There was a husband and wife who were Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen. Apon&#299;tolau laid down in their <i>balaua</i> and Apon&#299;bolinayen was in the house and she had a headache. &#8220;I am anxious to eat the fruit of the orange tree which belongs
to Gaw&#299;gawen of Adasen,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. Apon&#299;tolau heard her. &#8220;What is that?&#8221; he said to her. &#8220;I am anxious to eat the
<i>biw</i><a id="d0e4069src" href="#d0e4069" class="noteref">133</a> of Mataw&#299;t&aacute;wen.&#8221; &#8220;Give me a sack and I will go to get it,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau, and he went. As soon as Apon&#299;tolau filled the
sack with <i>biw</i> he went back home. As soon as he arrived in their house, &#8220;Here is the fruit you wished, Apon&#299;bolinayen. Come and get.&#8221; &#8220;Put
it on the bamboo hanger above the fire, and I will go and get some to eat when my head does not feel so badly, for I cannot
get up yet.&#8221; So Apon&#299;tolau went to put the fruit on the hanger above the fire and he laid down again in the <i>balaua</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e4078">As soon as Apon&#299;tolau laid down in the <i>balaua</i>, Apon&#299;bolinayen went to the kitchen and peeled one of the <i>biw</i> fruit and she ate it truly. As <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4086"></a>Page 99</span>soon as she ate she vomited and so she threw them away. &#8220;What is the matter, Apon&#299;bolinayen; I think you threw away the fruit.&#8221;
&#8220;One of them I dropped.&#8221; She went into the room and she said again, &#8220;I am anxious to eat the oranges of Gaw&#299;gawen of Adasen.&#8221;
&#8220;What is that?&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;I am anxious to eat fish roe,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. So Apon&#299;tolau went to get his fish net
and he fished in the river. As soon as he arrived at the river he threw his net and secured a fish with fish roe. He cut open
the fish and took out the roe. When he had taken out the roe he spat on the place where he had cut the fish and it became
alive again and swam in the river. After that he went back home. As soon as he arrived at their house he gave the fish to
Apon&#299;bolinayen, and he laid down in the <i>balaua</i> again, and Apon&#299;bolinayen went to the kitchen and she toasted the roe. When she finished she tasted it, and she vomited,
so she threw it away also. &#8220;What is the matter, Apon&#299;bolinayen? Why are the dogs barking?&#8221; &#8220;I dropped some of the roe.&#8221; She
went again to the room of the house. &#8220;I am anxious to eat the oranges which belong to Gaw&#299;gawen of Adasen.&#8221; &#8220;What is that,
Apon&#299;bolinayen,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;I am anxious to eat a deer's liver, I said.&#8221; So Apon&#299;tolau called his dogs and he went
to hunt deer. As soon as he arrived on the mountain, &#8220;Ala, my black dog, do not catch a deer unless it is in the low grass.
Ala, my dog B&#333;k&#333;, do not catch deer unless it is in a level field.&#8221; Not long after his dogs caught deer, and he took out their
livers. As soon as he took out the liver he spat on the places he had cut, and the deer ran away again. Not long after he
went back home. As soon as he arrived, &#8220;Here is the liver which you wanted. Come and take it.&#8221; &#8220;Put it in the kitchen. I will
go and fix it when my head does not hurt.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau put it in the kitchen and he went to the <i>balaua</i> again. When Apon&#299;tolau was in the <i>balaua</i>, Apon&#299;bolinayen went to the kitchen and cooked the liver and she tried to eat, but she vomited again, so she threw it away,
and the dogs all barked. &#8220;What is the matter? Why do the dogs bark? I think you threw away the livers.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen said,
&#8220;I threw away what I did not eat, for I did not eat all of it.&#8221; &#8220;Do not throw them away, for bye and bye I will eat, for it
is hard to go and get them.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e4097">Not long after she went again to the room, and Apon&#299;tolau thought that Apon&#299;bolinayen did not tell the truth, so he used his
power. &#8220;I use my power so that I will become a centipede.&#8221; So he became a centipede and he went in the crack of the floor
where Apon&#299;bolinayen was lying. Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen said again, &#8220;I am anxious to eat the oranges which belong to
Gaw&#299;gawen of Adasen.&#8221; &#8220;I know now what you want; why did you not tell the truth at first? That is <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4099"></a>Page 100</span>why you threw away all the things I went to get for you,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau, and he became a man and appeared to her. &#8220;I did
not tell the truth for I feared you would not return, for no one who has gone there has returned, so I am patient about my
headache.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e4101">&#8220;Ala, go and get rice straw, and I will wash my hair.&#8221; Not long after he went to wash his hair. When he finished washing his
hair he went to get one <i>lawed</i> vine, and he went back home. He planted the vine by the hearth. &#8220;Make some cakes for my provision on the journey.&#8221; &#8220;No, do
not go, Apon&#299;tolau,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;Make some, for if you do not I will go without provisions.&#8221; Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen
went to cook cakes. As soon as she finished, &#8220;Ala, you come and oil my hair.&#8221; As soon as she oiled his hair, &#8220;Go and get my
dark clout and my belt and my headband.&#8221; So Apon&#299;bolinayen went to get them. As soon as he dressed he took his spear and headaxe
and he told Apon&#299;bolinayen that if the <i>lawed</i> leaves wilted he was dead.<a id="d0e4109src" href="#d0e4109" class="noteref">134</a> So he went.

</p>
<p id="d0e4115">As soon as he arrived at the well of Gimbangonan all the betel-nut trees bowed, and Gimbangonan shouted and all the world
trembled. &#8220;How strange that all the world trembles when that lady shouts.&#8221; So Apon&#299;tolau took a walk. Not long after the old
woman Alokot&aacute;n saw him and she sent her little dog to bite his leg, and it took out part of his leg. &#8220;Do not proceed, for you have a bad sign. If you go, you cannot return to your town,&#8221; said the old woman Alokot&aacute;n. &#8220;No, I
can go back.&#8221; So he went. As soon as he arrived at the home of the lightning, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; said the lightning. &#8220;I
am going to get the oranges from Gaw&#299;gawen of Adasen. Go and stand on the high stone and I will see what your sign is.&#8221; So
he went and stood on the high stone and the lightning made a light and Apon&#299;tolau dodged. &#8220;Do not go, for you have a bad sign,
and Gaw&#299;gawen will secure you.&#8221; &#8220;No, I am going.&#8221; So he went. As soon as he arrived at the place of <i>Sil&#299;t</i><a id="d0e4121src" href="#d0e4121" class="noteref">135</a> it said to him, &#8220;Where are you going, Apon&#299;tolau?&#8221; &#8220;I am going to get the oranges of Gaw&#299;gawen of Adasen.&#8221; &#8220;Stand on top
of that high stone so I can see if you have a good sign.&#8221; So he went and <i>Sil&#299;t</i> made a great noise. As soon as he made the great noise he jumped. &#8220;Go back, Apon&#299;tolau, and start another time, for you have
a bad sign.&#8221;<a id="d0e4127src" href="#d0e4127" class="noteref">136</a> &#8220;No, I go.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e4133">He arrived at the ocean and he used magic. &#8220;I use my power so that you, my headaxe, sail as fast as you can when I stand on
you.&#8221; <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4135"></a>Page 101</span>As soon as he stood on it it sailed very fast. Not long after he was across the ocean and he was at the other edge of the
ocean and he walked again. Not long after he arrived at the spring where the women went to get water. &#8220;Good morning, you women
who are dipping water from the spring.&#8221; &#8220;Good morning. If you are an enemy cut us in only one place so we will not need to
cure so much.&#8221; &#8220;If I was an enemy I would have killed all of you when I arrived here.&#8221; After that he asked them, &#8220;Is this the spring of Gaw&#299;gawen of Adasen?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; said the women. So he sent the women
to the town to tell Gaw&#299;gawen, and the women did not tell him for he was asleep. So he went up to the town, but did not go
inside, because the bank reached almost up to the sky, and he could not get in. He was sorrowful and bent his head.

</p>
<p id="d0e4140">Soon the chief of the spiders went to him: &#8220;What are you feeling sorry about, Apon&#299;tolau?&#8221; &#8220;I feel sorry because I cannot
climb up the bank and go into the town.&#8221; &#8220;Do not feel sorry. You wait for me while I go up and put some thread which you can
hold,&#8221; said the chief of the spiders.<a id="d0e4142src" href="#d0e4142" class="noteref">137</a> So Apon&#299;tolau waited for him. Not long after the spider said, &#8220;Now you can climb;&#8221; so Apon&#299;tolau climbed on the thread. After he got inside of the town of Gaw&#299;gawen he went directly to the house of Gaw&#299;gawen.
When he arrived there Gaw&#299;gawen was still asleep in his <i>balaua</i>. As soon as he woke up and saw Apon&#299;tolau sitting by his <i>balaua</i> he stood and ran to his house and got his headaxe and spear. Apon&#299;tolau said to him, &#8220;Good morning, Cousin Gaw&#299;gawen. Do
not be angry with me. I came here to buy your oranges for my wife. Apon&#299;bolinayen wishes to eat one, for she always has a
headache, because she has nothing she can eat.&#8221; Gaw&#299;gawen took him to his house, and he fed him one carabao. &#8220;If you cannot
eat all of the carabao which I give you, you cannot have the oranges which your wife wishes to eat.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau was sorrowful,
for he thought he could not eat all of the carabao and he bent his head. Not long after the chiefs of the ants and flies went
to him. &#8220;What makes you feel so badly, Apon&#299;tolau?&#8221; they said to him. &#8220;I am sorrowful, for I cannot get the oranges which
Apon&#299;bolinayen wishes to eat until I eat this carabao which Gaw&#299;gawen feeds to me.&#8221; &#8220;Do not be sorrowful,&#8221; said the chiefs
of the ants and flies. So they called all the ants and flies to go and eat all the meat and rice. Not long after the flies
and ants finished eating the meat and rice, and Apon&#299;tolau was very glad and he went to Gaw&#299;gawen and said to him, &#8220;I have
finished eating the food which you gave me.&#8221; Gaw&#299;gawen was surprised. &#8220;What did you do?&#8221; &#8220;I ate all of it.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e4157">Gaw&#299;gawen took him where the oranges were and Apon&#299;tolau saw <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4159"></a>Page 102</span>that the branches of the tree were sharp knives. Gaw&#299;gawen said to him, &#8220;Go and climb the tree and get all you want.&#8221; He went
to climb. When he got two of the oranges he stepped on one of the knives and he was cut. So he fastened the fruit to his spear
and it flew back to Kadalayapan. Not long after the fruit dropped on the floor in the kitchen and Apon&#299;bolinayen heard it,
and she went into the kitchen. As soon as she got there she saw the fruit and she ate it at once, and the spear said to her,
&#8220;Apon&#299;tolau is in Adasen. He sent me first to bring you the oranges which you wished.&#8221; As soon as she ate the oranges she
went to look at the <i>lawed</i> vine by the stove and it was wilted, and she knew that Apon&#299;tolau was dead.

</p>
<p id="d0e4164">Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen gave birth and every time they bathed the baby it grew one span and soon it was large.<a id="d0e4166src" href="#d0e4166" class="noteref">138</a> He often went to play with the other children and his mother gave him a golden top which had belonged to his father when
he was a little boy. When he struck the tops of the other children they were broken at once. Not long after he struck the
garbage pot of the old woman, and she was angry and said, &#8220;If you are a brave boy, you go and get your father whom Gaw&#299;gawen
of Adasen has inherited.&#8221; And Kanag went back to their house crying. &#8220;I did not have a father, you said, mother, but the old
woman said he was inherited by Gaw&#299;gawen, when he went to get the orange fruit. Now prepare provisions for me to take, for
I am going to get my father.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen said to him, &#8220;Do not go or Gaw&#299;gawen will get you as he did your father.&#8221; But
Kanag said, &#8220;If you do not let me go and do not give me food, I will go without anything.&#8221; Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen cooked
food for him and Kanag was ready to go, and he took his headaxe which was one span long and his spear. Not long after he went.


</p>
<p id="d0e4172">As soon as he got to the gate of the town he struck his shield and it sounded like one thousand people, and everyone was surprised.
&#8220;How brave that boy is! We think he is braver than his father. He can strike his shield and it sounds like one thousand.&#8221;
When he arrived at the spring of Gimbangonan he was still striking his shield, and when Gimbangonan heard she said, &#8220;Someone
is going to fight.&#8221; He shouted, for he was very happy and the world trembled and Kanag looked like a flitting bird, for he
was always moving.

</p>
<p id="d0e4174">As soon as he arrived at the place where Alokot&aacute;n lived she sent her dog against him, and the dog ran at him, and Kanag cut
off its head. &#8220;How brave you are, little boy! Where are you going?&#8221; &#8220;Where are you going, you say, I am going to Adasen to
follow my father.&#8221; &#8220;Your <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4176"></a>Page 103</span>father is dead. I hope you secure him, for you have a good sign,&#8221; said Alokot&aacute;n. So Kanag went on in a hurry. Not long after
he arrived at the place where the thunder was and it said, &#8220;Where are you going, little boy?&#8221; &#8220;I am going to follow my father
in Adasen.&#8221; &#8220;Go and stand on the high stone and see what your sign is.&#8221; So he went. As soon as he stood on the high stone
the thunder rolled, but Kanag did not move and the thunder was surprised. &#8220;Go at once; I think you can get your father whom Gaw&#299;gawen inherits.&#8221; So Kanag went. Not long after he arrived at the place
of the lightning, and he made him stand on the high stone. As soon as he stood on it the lightning made a big noise and flash,
but he did not move. So the boy went at once, for he had a good sign.

</p>
<p id="d0e4180">Kanag struck his shield until it sounded like a thousand people, and all the women who were dipping water at the spring of
Gaw&#299;gawen were surprised, for they saw only a little boy, who struck his shield, approaching them, and it sounded like a thousand.
As soon as he arrived at the spring, &#8220;Good morning, women who are dipping water. Go and tell Gaw&#299;gawen of Adasen that he must
prepare for I am going to fight with him.&#8221; So all the women ran to the town and told Gaw&#299;gawen that a strange boy was at the
spring. Gaw&#299;gawen said to the women, &#8220;Go and tell him that if it is true that he is brave he will come into the town if he
can.&#8221; So one of the women went to tell him and he went.

</p>
<p id="d0e4182">When he arrived at the bank which reached to the sky Kanag used his power and he jumped like the flitting bird, and he entered
the town and went directly to the <i>balaua</i> and house of Gaw&#299;gawen of Adasen. Not long after he had arrived he saw that the roof of his house and <i>balaua</i> was of hair and around his town were heads, and Kanag said, &#8220;This is why my father did not return. It is true that Gaw&#299;gawen
is a brave man, but I think I can kill him.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e4190">As soon as Gaw&#299;gawen saw Kanag in the yard of his house he said, &#8220;How brave you are, little boy! Why did you come here?&#8221; &#8220;I
came to get my father, for you secured him when he came to get the oranges which my mother wanted. If you do not wish to give
my father to me I will kill you.&#8221; And Gaw&#299;gawen laughed at him and said, &#8220;One of my fingers will fight you. You will not go
back to your town. You will be like your father.&#8221; Kanag said, &#8220;We shall see. Go and get your arms and we will fight here in
the yard of your house.&#8221; Gaw&#299;gawen became angry and he went to get his headaxe, which was as big as half of the sky, and his spear. As soon as he
returned to the place where Kanag was waiting he said, &#8220;Can you see my headaxe, little boy? If I put this on you you cannot
get it off. So you throw first so you can show how brave you are.&#8221; Kanag said to him, &#8220;No, you must be first, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4195"></a>Page 104</span>so you will know that I am a brave boy.&#8221; Gaw&#299;gawen tried to put his headaxe on him and the boy used his power and he became
a small ant and Gaw&#299;gawen laughed at him and said, &#8220;Now, the little boy is gone.&#8221; Not long after the little boy stood on his
headaxe and he was surprised. &#8220;Little boy, you are the first who has done this. Your father did not do this. It is true that
you are brave; if you can dodge my spear I am sure you will get your father.&#8221; So he threw his spear at him and Kanag used his power and he disappeared and Gaw&#299;gawen was surprised. &#8220;You are the next.&#8221;
Then Kanag used magic so that when he threw his spear against him it would go directly to the body of Gaw&#299;gawen. As soon as
he threw Gaw&#299;gawen laid down. Kanag ran to him and cut off his five heads and there was one left, and Gaw&#299;gawen said to him,
&#8220;Do not cut off my last head and I will go and show you where your father is.&#8221; So Kanag did not cut off the last head, and
they went to see his father. The skin of his father had been used to cover a drum, and his hair was used to decorate the house,
and his head was placed by the gate of the town, and the body was put below the house.

</p>
<p id="d0e4200">As soon as Kanag had gathered together the body of his father he used his power and he said, &#8220;I whip my perfume <i>banaw&#7431;s</i> and directly he will say <span class="smallcaps">Wes</span>.&#8221;<a id="d0e4208src" href="#d0e4208" class="noteref">139</a> His father said, &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Wes</span>.&#8221; Not long after he said, &#8220;I whip my perfume <i>alakadakad</i> and directly he will stand up.&#8221; So his father stood beside him. After that he whipped his perfume <i>dag&#299;monau</i> and his father woke up and he was surprised to see the little boy by him and he said, &#8220;Who are you? How long I slept.&#8221; &#8220;I
am your son. &#8216;How long I slept,&#8217; you said. You were dead and Gaw&#299;gawen inherited you. Take my headaxe and cut off the remaining
head of Gaw&#299;gawen.&#8221; So he took the headaxe of Kanag and went to the place where Gaw&#299;gawen stood. When he struck the headaxe
against Gaw&#299;gawen it did not hurt him and Apon&#299;tolau slipped, and his son laughed at him. &#8220;What is the matter with you, father?
Gaw&#299;gawen looks as if he were dead, for he has only one head left.&#8221; He took the headaxe from his father and he went to Gaw&#299;gawen
and he cut off the remaining head. Not long after they used magic so that the headaxes and spears went to kill all the people
in the town. So the spears and headaxes went among the people and killed all of them, and Apon&#299;tolau swam in the blood and
his son stood on the blood. &#8220;What is the matter with you, father, that you swim in the blood? Can't you use your power so
you don't have to swim?&#8221; Then he took hold of him and lifted him up. As soon as all the people were killed they used their
power so that all the heads and valuable things went to Kadalayapan.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4223"></a>Page 105</span></p>
<p id="d0e4224">Apon&#299;bolinayen went to look at the <i>lawed</i> vine behind the stove and it looked like a jungle it was so green, so she believed that her son was alive. Not long after
all the heads arrived in Kadalayapan and Apon&#299;bolinayen was surprised. Not long after she saw her husband and her son and
she shouted and the world smiled. Not long after they went up into their house and summoned all the people and told them to
invite all the people in other towns for Kanag had returned from fighting, and had his father. So the people went to invite
their relatives. Not long after the people from other towns arrived and they danced. They were all glad that Apon&#299;tolau was
alive again, and they went to see the heads of Gaw&#299;gawen who killed Apon&#299;tolau.

</p>
<p id="d0e4229">As soon as the people returned to their towns, when the party was over, Apon&#299;tolau went to take a walk. When he reached the
brook he sat down on a stone and the big frog went to lap up his spittle. Not long after the big frog had a little baby.<a id="d0e4231src" href="#d0e4231" class="noteref">140</a> Not long after she gave birth, and the <i>anitos</i><a id="d0e4239src" href="#d0e4239" class="noteref">141</a> went to get the little baby and flew away with it. They used their power so that the baby grew fast and it was a girl, and
they taught her how to make <i>dawak</i>.<a id="d0e4245src" href="#d0e4245" class="noteref">142</a> Not long after the girl knew how to make <i>dawak</i>, and every time she rang the dish to summon the spirits.

</p>
<p id="d0e4254">Kanag went to follow his father, but he did not find him where he had been sitting by the brook, and Kanag heard the sound
of the ringing which sounded like the <i>banan&acirc;yo</i>.<a id="d0e4259src" href="#d0e4259" class="noteref">143</a> As soon as he heard it he stood still and listened. Not long after he used his power so that he became a bird and he flew.
As soon as he arrived at the place where the girl was making <i>dawak</i> she said to him, &#8220;You are the only person who has come here. If you are an enemy cut me in only one place so I will not have
so much to heal.&#8221; &#8220;I am not an enemy; I came here for I heard what you were doing; so I became a bird and flew.&#8221; Kanag gave
betel-nut to her and they chewed. Their quids looked like the beads <i>pinogalan,</i> so they knew that they were brother and sister. The girl said to him, &#8220;Go inside of the big iron caldron so that the <i>anitos</i> who care for me will not eat you.&#8221; So Kanag went inside of the big iron caldron. When the <i>anitos</i> did not arrive at the accustomed time Kanag went out of the caldron and said to his sister, &#8220;Now, my sister, I will take
you to Kadalayapan. Our father and mother do not know that I have a sister. Do not stay always with the <i>anitos</i>&#8221; His sister replied, &#8220;I <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4277"></a>Page 106</span>cannot go to Sud&#299;pan<a id="d0e4279src" href="#d0e4279" class="noteref">144</a> when no one is making <i>balaua</i>, for I always make <i>dawak</i> as the <i>anitos</i> taught me. If I come in Sud&#299;pan when no one is making <i>balaua</i> it would make all of the people very ill.&#8221; So Kanag went home.

</p>
<p id="d0e4297">As soon as he arrived he told his father and mother to make <i>balaua</i> for he wanted his sister to see them. &#8220;We just made <i>balaua</i>. How can we make <i>balaua</i> again?&#8221; said his father and mother. &#8220;I want you to see my sister whom I found up in the air, where the <i>anitos</i> took her.&#8221; &#8220;You are crazy, Kanag; you have no sisters or brothers; you are the only child we have.&#8221; Kanag said to them, &#8220;It
is sure that I have a sister. I don't know why you did not know about her. The <i>anitos</i> took her when she was a little baby and they taught her how to make <i>dawak</i>, and she always makes <i>dawak</i>. I wanted to bring her when I came back, but she said she could not come to Sud&#299;pan when no one makes <i>balaua</i>, for she is always making <i>dawak</i>. She said if she came to Sud&#299;pan and did not make <i>dawak</i> everyone would be ill, so I did not bring her. If you wish to see your daughter, father, make <i>balaua</i> at once.&#8221; So they made <i>balaua</i>, for they wished to see their daughter.

</p>
<p id="d0e4335">They sent messengers to go and get betel-nuts which were covered with gold, and when they had secured the betel-nuts they
oiled them and sent them to the different towns where their relatives lived, and they sent one into the air to go and get
their daughter Agten-nga&#7431;yan. So all the betel-nuts went and invited the people to the <i>balaua</i>. As soon as the betel-nut went up into the air it arrived where Agten-nga&#7431;yan was making <i>dawak</i>. When she saw the betel-nut beside her she was startled, for it was covered with gold. She tried to cut it up, for she wished
to chew it, and the betel-nut said, &#8220;Do not cut me, for your brother and father in Kadalayapan sent me to summon you to their
<i>balaua</i>, for they are anxious to see you.&#8221; So Agten-nga&#7431;yan told the <i>anitos</i> that a betel-nut which was covered with gold had come to take her to Apon&#299;tolau who was making <i>Sayang</i>, and they wished to see her. The <i>anitos</i> let her go, but they advised her to return. So she went.

</p>
<p id="d0e4358">When they arrived in Kadalayapan the people from the other towns were dancing and she went below the <i>talagan</i>,<a id="d0e4363src" href="#d0e4363" class="noteref">145</a> and Kanag went to see what it was that looked like a flame beneath the <i>talagan</i>. When he reached her he saw it was his sister and he tried to take her away from the <i>talagan</i>, and she said to him, &#8220;I cannot get off from here, for the <i>anitos</i> who care for me told me to stay here until someone comes to make <i>dawak</i> with me.&#8221; So they sent the old woman Alokot&aacute;n to <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4378"></a>Page 107</span>make <i>dawak</i> with her. All the people were surprised, for she made a pleasanter sound when she rang and they thought she was a <i>banan&aacute;yo</i><a id="d0e4385src" href="#d0e4385" class="noteref">146</a>. The young men who went to attend the <i>balaua</i> loved her, for she was pretty and knew very well how to sing the <i>dawak</i>. As soon as they finished the <i>dawak</i> she was free to leave the <i>talagan</i>, so her brother Kanag took her and put her in his belt<a id="d0e4403src" href="#d0e4403" class="noteref">147</a> and he put her in the high house<a id="d0e4409src" href="#d0e4409" class="noteref">148</a> so the young men could not reach her.

</p>
<p id="d0e4415">As soon as the <i>balaua</i> was over the people went home, but the young men still remained below the house watching her, and the ground below became
muddy, for they always remained there.

</p>
<p id="d0e4420">When Kanag saw the young men below the house fighting about her, he took her again into the air so that the young men could
not see her. As soon as they arrived in the air they met the <i>anitos</i>, and Kanag said to them, &#8220;I intended to keep my sister in Sud&#299;pan, for I had made a little golden house for her to live in,
but I have brought her back, for all the young men are fighting about her.&#8221; The <i>anitos</i> were glad that she was back with them and they gave Kanag more power, so that when he should go to war he would always destroy
his opponents. Agten-nga&#7431;yan used to go and teach the women how to make <i>dawak</i> when anyone made <i>balaua</i>, so that she taught them very well how to make <i>dawak</i>. This is all.

<p id="d0e4442">&#8220;Ala, Apon&#299;bolinayen prepare our things, for we are going to plant sugar cane,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. Not long after they went
to see the cuttings and they were big. They took them and planted them when they arrived at the place where they wished to
plant them. Apon&#299;tolau planted them and Apon&#299;bolinayen watered them. Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen used magic and she said,
&#8220;I use my power so that all the cuttings will be planted.&#8221; Soon they truly were all planted, so they went back home. After
seven days Apon&#299;tolau went to look at them and their leaves were long and pointed so he used magic and said, &#8220;I used my power
so that after five days all the sugar cane which we planted will be ready to chew.&#8221; Then he went back home. In five days he
went again to see them and as soon as he arrived at the planting he saw they were all tall and about ready to chew.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4444"></a>Page 108</span></p>
<p id="d0e4445">Not long after Gaygay&oacute;ma looked down on the sugar cane and she was anxious to chew it. &#8220;Ala, my father Bagbagak,<a id="d0e4447src" href="#d0e4447" class="noteref">149</a> send the stars to go and get some of the sugar cane which I saw, for I am anxious to chew it,&#8221; she said, for she was pregnant
and desired to chew the sugar cane. Not long after, &#8220;Ala, you Sal&#299;bobo<a id="d0e4450src" href="#d0e4450" class="noteref">150</a> and Bitbit&oacute;wen<a id="d0e4453src" href="#d0e4453" class="noteref">151</a> let us go and get the sugar cane, for Gaygay&oacute;ma is anxious to chew it,&#8221; said Bagbagak. Not long after they went. As soon
as they arrived where the sugar cane was, they went inside of the bamboo fence and some of them secured the beans which Apon&#299;bolinayen
had planted. The stems of the bean pods were gold, and they got five of them. Most of them got one stalk of sugar cane. As
soon as they secured them they went back up. When they arrived Gaygay&oacute;ma chewed one of the sugar cane stalks and she felt
happy and well, and she saw the beans with the golden stems and she cooked and ate them.

<p id="d0e4459">When she had chewed all the sugar cane which the stars had secured, she said, &#8220;Ala, my father Bagbagak, come and follow me
to the place where the sugar cane grows, for I am anxious to see it.&#8221; Not long after, &#8220;Ala, Sal&#299;bobo and Bitbit&oacute;wen we are
going to follow Gaygay&oacute;ma, for she wishes to go and see the place of the sugar cane. Some of you stay outside of the fence
to watch and see if anyone comes, and some of you get sugar cane,&#8221; said Bagbagak to them, and the moon shone on them. Soon
they all arrived at the place of the sugar cane and they made a noise while they were getting the sugar cane, which they used
to chew. Gaygay&oacute;ma went to the middle of the field and chewed sugar cane. As soon as they had chewed all they wished they
flew up again.

</p>
<p id="d0e4461">The next day Apon&#299;tolau said to Apon&#299;bolinayen, &#8220;I am going to see our sugar cane, to see if any carabao have gone there to
spoil it, for it is the best to chew.&#8221; So he went. As soon as he arrived he saw that the sugar cane was spoiled, and he looked.
He saw that there were many places near the fence where someone had chewed, for each one of the stars had gone by the fence
to chew the cane which they wished. When he reached the middle of the field he saw the cane there which had been chewed, and
there was some gold on the refuse and he was surprised and he said, &#8220;How strange this is! I think some beautiful girl must
have chewed this cane. I will try to watch and see who it is. Perhaps they will return tonight.&#8221; Then he went back home. As
soon as he reached home he said, &#8220;Ala, Apon&#299;bolinayen cook our food early, for <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4463"></a>Page 109</span>I want to go and watch our sugar cane; someone has gone and spoiled it. They have also spoiled our beans which we planted.&#8221;
So Apon&#299;bolinayen cooked even though it was not time. As soon as she finished cooking she called Apon&#299;tolau and they ate.
When they had eaten he went and he hid a little distance from the sugar cane.

</p>
<p id="d0e4465">In the middle of the night there were many stars falling down into the sugar cane field and Apon&#299;tolau heard the cane being
broken. Soon he saw the biggest of them which looked like a big flame of fire fall into the field. Not long after he saw one
of the other stars at the edge of the fence take off her dress, which was like a star, and he saw that she looked like the
half of the rainbow, and the stars which followed her got the sugar cane which they wished. They chewed it by the fence and
they watched to see if anyone was coming. Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;What shall I do, because of those companions of the beautiful
woman? If I do not frighten them they will eat me. The best thing for me to do is to frighten them. I will go and sit on the
star's dress.&#8221;<a id="d0e4467src" href="#d0e4467" class="noteref">152</a> He frightened them. The stars flew up and Apon&#299;tolau went and sat on the star dress.

</p>
<p id="d0e4473">Not long after the pretty girl came from the middle of the field to get her star dress; she saw Apon&#299;tolau sitting on it.
&#8220;You, &#298;pogau,<a id="d0e4475src" href="#d0e4475" class="noteref">153</a> you must pardon us, for we came to steal your sugar cane, for we were anxious to chew it.&#8221; &#8220;If you came to get some of my
sugar cane it is all right. The best thing for you to do is to sit down, for I wish to know your name, for we &#298;pogau have
the custom to tell our names. It is bad for us if we do not know each others' names when we talk.&#8221; Not long after he gave
her betel-nut and the woman chewed it. As soon as they chewed, &#8220;Now that we have chewed according to our custom we will tell
our names.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, if that is what you say, but you must tell your name first,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;tolau who
am the husband of Apon&#299;bolinayen of Kadalayapan.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Gaygay&oacute;ma who am the daughter of Bagbagak and S&#299;nag,<a id="d0e4478src" href="#d0e4478" class="noteref">154</a> up in the air,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;Ala, now you, Apon&#299;tolau, even though you have a wife I am going to take you up, for I wish
to marry you. If you do not wish to come I will call my companion stars, and give you to them to eat.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau was frightened,
for he knew that the woman who was talking was a spirit. &#8220;If that is what you say, and you do not wish me to go and see Apon&#299;bolinayen
and you wish to be married to me, it is all right,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau to her. Not long after the stars <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4481"></a>Page 110</span>dropped the <i>galong-galong</i><a id="d0e4485src" href="#d0e4485" class="noteref">155</a> of gold which Gaygay&oacute;ma had ordered to be made. As soon as they dropped it Apon&#299;tolau and Gaygay&oacute;ma got in it, and were drawn
up, and soon they were there.

</p>
<p id="d0e4488">As soon as they arrived he saw one of the stars come to the place where they were, and it was a very big star, for it was
Bagbagak. &#8220;Someone is coming where we are,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau to Gaygay&oacute;ma. &#8220;Do not be afraid; he is my father,&#8221; said Gaygay&oacute;ma.
&#8220;Those stars eat people if you do anything wrong to them.&#8221; Not long after Bagbagak reached the place where they were. &#8220;It
is good for you Apon&#299;tolau that you wished to follow my daughter here. If you had not we would have eaten you,&#8221; he said. Apon&#299;tolau
was frightened. &#8220;Yes, I followed her here, but I am ashamed before you who live here, for you are powerful,&#8221; he said. While
they were talking Bagbagak went back home.

</p>
<p id="d0e4490">After he had lived with Gaygay&oacute;ma five months she had him prick between her last fingers and a little baby popped out, and
it was a beautiful baby boy. &#8220;What shall we call our son?&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;We are going to call him Tabyayen, because it
is the name of the people who used to live above,&#8221; said Gaygay&oacute;ma. So they called him Tabyayen, and they used their power
so that the baby grew all the time. Soon he was big. After three months, &#8220;Now Gaygay&oacute;ma, let me go back down and see Apon&#299;bolinayen
of Kadalayapan. I think she is searching for me. I will return soon, for you two are my wives,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau, but Gaygay&oacute;ma
would not let him go. &#8220;Ala, let me go and I will return soon,&#8221; he said again. &#8220;Ala, you go, but you come back here soon. I
will send the stars to eat you if you do not wish to return,&#8221; said Gaygay&oacute;ma to him. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. Not long after he rode
again in the <i>galong-galong</i>, and the stars followed, and they went down. Apon&#299;tolau wanted all of them to go to Kadalayapan, but he went alone and the
stars and Gaygay&oacute;ma and the boy went up.

</p>
<p id="d0e4495">Not long after Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Wes</span>&#8221; at the entrance to the yard of their house in Kadalayapan. Apon&#299;bolinayen got up from her mat and she had not eaten for
a long time. When she looked at him she was very happy. Apon&#299;tolau saw that she was thin. &#8220;Why are you so thin, Apon&#299;bolinayen?&#8221;
said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;I have not eaten since you went away. Where have you been so long? I thought that you were dead.&#8221; &#8220;No, I
did not die, but Gaygay&oacute;ma took me up into the sky because they were the ones who spoilt our sugar cane. She would not let
me come back any more, and she took me up. I did not want <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4500"></a>Page 111</span>to go with her, but she threatened to feed me to the stars who were her companions. So I was afraid, and I went with her,
for she is a spirit.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e4502">When the day came on which Apon&#299;tolau and Gaygay&oacute;ma had agreed for his return up, Apon&#299;tolau failed to go, because Apon&#299;bolinayen
would not let him go. In the evening many stars came to the yard of their house and some of them went to the windows and some
of them went beside the wall of the house, and they were very bright and the house looked as though it was burning. The stars
said, &#8220;We smell the odor of the &#298;pogau and we are anxious to eat.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;Hide me, Apon&#299;bolinayen, for those stars
have come to eat me, because you would not let me go back to Gaygay&oacute;ma. I told you that if I did not go back to her she would
send the stars to eat me, and now truly they have come. I told you I would come back, but you would not let me go.&#8221; Not long
after the stars went inside of the house where they were, and they said to Apon&#299;tolau, &#8220;Do not hide from us, Apon&#299;tolau. We
know where you are. You are in the corner of the house.&#8221; &#8220;Come out of there or we will eat you,&#8221; said Bagbagak. Soon he appeared
to them and they said to him, &#8220;Do you not wish to come back up with us?&#8221; &#8220;I will go with you,&#8221; he answered, for he was afraid.
So they did not eat him, for Gaygay&oacute;ma had told them not to eat him if he was willing to follow them. Not long after they
flew away with him and Apon&#299;bolinayen cried. When they arrived up Gaygay&oacute;ma said, &#8220;Why, Apon&#299;tolau, did you lie to me and
not return? You were fortunate when you followed the stars, for if you had not they would have eaten you.&#8221; &#8220;I did not return
because Apon&#299;bolinayen would not let me. You and she are my wives. Do not blame me,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau.

</p>
<p id="d0e4504">After he had lived with her eight months he said, &#8220;Now, I am going to leave you, for our son Tabyayen is large. If you will
not let me take our son Tabyayen down, he can stay up here with you.&#8221; &#8220;You may go now, but you cannot take our son. You will
return here,&#8221; said Gaygay&oacute;ma. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. So they went down again in the <i>galong-galong.</i> Apon&#299;tolau wanted to take them to Kadalayapan, but they would not go with him. &#8220;No, do not take us, for it is not our custom
to stay down here; we are always above,&#8221; they said. So they went up and Apon&#299;tolau went to Kadalayapan. Not long after he
said, &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Wes</span>&#8221; at the yard of the house, and Apon&#299;bolinayen went to see who it was. She saw that it was Apon&#299;tolau, and she was very glad.


</p>
<p id="d0e4512">After one year with Apon&#299;bolinayen he said, &#8220;Command someone to pound rice, for we are going to make <i>balaua</i>, and I am going to call our son Tabyayen from above.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen had also given birth five days after Gaygay&oacute;ma had given
birth, and they called the boy Kanag.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4517"></a>Page 112</span></p>
<p id="d0e4518">Not long after Apon&#299;tolau went to take Tabyayen from above and Gaygay&oacute;ma was very glad to see him. When they were talking
he said, &#8220;Now I am going to take Tabyayen down, for I want him to attend our <i>Sayang</i>.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, you may take him, but you must bring him back when the <i>Sayang</i> is finished.&#8221; So Apon&#299;tolau took the boy to attend the <i>balaua</i> in Kadalayapan. As soon as they arrived there he began to play with Kanag and they were the same size and looked alike, because
they were half brothers. While they were playing, during the <i>Sayang,</i> Kanag said, &#8220;Mother, it is showering,&#8221; and Apon&#299;tolau heard what the boy said to Apon&#299;bolinayen. He said, &#8220;It is the tears
of Tabyayen's mother, for I think she is thinking of him. I told them not to go over there, but they went anyway. I think
Gaygay&oacute;ma saw them playing and she cried.&#8221; Then Apon&#299;bolinayen went to take them away from the yard where they were playing.
She took them upstairs. It was at the time when they were building the <i>balaua</i>. Not long after that they made <i>L&#299;bon</i>,<a id="d0e4538src" href="#d0e4538" class="noteref">156</a> and they invited Gaygay&oacute;ma and all their relatives from the other towns and they danced for one month. Then the people from
the other towns went home. As soon as all the people had gone home Apon&#299;tolau went to take back the boy to his mother Gaygay&oacute;ma.

</p>
<p id="d0e4544">When they arrived where Gaygay&oacute;ma lived he gave the boy to her and he staid there three days. After three days he went back
home, and he said, &#8220;I am going now, but I will come back in a few days, for I cannot live here all the time, for we, &#298;pogau,
are accustomed to live below, and I also have another wife there. I cannot leave Apon&#299;bolinayen alone most of the time.&#8221; So
Gaygayoma let him go down and she said, &#8220;Yes, you may go, but you come back sometimes.&#8221; &#8220;It is good that Tabyayen came down
and made <i>Sayang</i> with us.&#8221; Then he went down again. When he arrived down Apon&#299;bolinayen was glad to see him, for she feared he would not return
to Kadalayapan. Not long after they arranged for Kanag to be married, and as soon as Kanag was married they arranged for Tabyayen
also and he lived down below and Gaygay&oacute;ma always staid above.

</p><a id="d0e4551"></a><h2>15</h2>
<p id="d0e4554">&#8220;I am going to wash my hair,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. Not long after he went to the river and washed his hair. As soon as he finished
he took a bath and went back home. When he arrived in his house he said, &#8220;Apon&#299;bolinayen, please comb my hair.&#8221; &#8220;Take the
comb and <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4556"></a>Page 113</span>go to Indi&aacute;pan, for I have no time,&#8221; answered Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;If you have no time, give it to me then,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau.
Apon&#299;bolinayen was angry and went to get it for him. &#8220;What is the matter that you cannot go and get it yourself?&#8221; As soon
as he got it Apon&#299;tolau went to Indi&aacute;pan.

</p>
<p id="d0e4558">Kabkabaga-an, who lived up in the air, was looking down, and said, &#8220;Indi&aacute;pan, you have good fortune, for Apon&#299;tolau will come
and ask you to comb his hair.&#8221; Not long after Apon&#299;tolau arrived. &#8220;Will you comb my hair, Indi&aacute;pan, because Apon&#299;bolinayen
is impatient and does not want to comb my hair?&#8221; &#8220;I am sleepy,&#8221; said Indi&aacute;pan. She sat down. &#8220;Ala, you come and comb my hair,&#8221;
said Apon&#299;tolau. Not long after Indi&aacute;pan went to comb his hair and Apon&#299;tolau sat by the door. Kabkabaga-an looked down on
them and said, &#8220;Indi&aacute;pan has a good fortune, for she is combing the hair of Apon&#299;tolau.&#8221; When she had combed his hair she
went to lie down again and Apon&#299;tolau said to her, &#8220;Will you please cut this betel-nut into pieces, Indi&aacute;pan.&#8221; &#8220;You cut it.
I am sleepy,&#8221; answered Indi&aacute;pan. &#8220;Hand me the headaxe then.&#8221; So Indi&aacute;pan handed the headaxe to him. As soon as she gave the
headaxe to him she went to lie down again. When Apon&#299;tolau had cut the betel-nut he cut his first finger of his left hand.
The blood went up in the air. &#8220;Ala, Indi&aacute;pan, take your belt, for I cannot stop my finger from bleeding. Come and wrap it,&#8221;
said Apon&#299;tolau to her. So Indi&aacute;pan got up and she went to get her belt and she wrapped his finger, but the blood did not
stop, so she called Apon&#299;bolinayen, for she was frightened when she saw the blood go up. Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;What is the
matter with you?&#8221; She took her hat which looked like a woodpecker and she went, and the sunshine stopped when she went down
out of her house, and Kabkabaga-an saw Apon&#299;bolinayen going to Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;What good fortune Apon&#299;bolinayen has, for she
is going to see Apon&#299;tolau.&#8221; As soon as she arrived where Indi&aacute;pan lived she wrapped her belt around the finger of Apon&#299;tolau,
but the blood did not stop and they were frightened. Apon&#299;bolinayen commanded their spirit helpers to get Ginal&#299;ngan of Pindayan,
who was a sister of Iwaginan, to make <i>dawak</i><a id="d0e4562src" href="#d0e4562" class="noteref">157</a> and stop the blood of Apon&#299;tolau. Not long after Indi&aacute;pan and the spirit helpers arrived where Ginal&#299;ngan lived they said,
&#8220;Good afternoon, you must excuse us, for we cannot stay here long, for Apon&#299;bolinayen is in a hurry to have you come to Kaldalayapan
to see Apon&#299;tolau. He cut his finger and his blood will not stop running, and we do not know what to do. You come and make
<i>dawak</i>&#8221; Ginal&#299;ngan said, &#8220;Even though I should go to make <i>dawak</i> we could do nothing, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4574"></a>Page 114</span>for Kabkabaga-an, who lives in the air, loves him.&#8221; &#8220;We must try and see if Kabkabaga-an will stop,&#8221; said Indi&aacute;pan, and Ginal&#299;ngan
went with them.

</p>
<p id="d0e4576">As soon as they arrived in Kadalayapan Apon&#299;bolinayen said to Ginal&#299;ngan, &#8220;What is best for us to do for Apon&#299;tolau's finger?&#8221;
Ginal&#299;ngan said, &#8220;We cannot do anything. I told Indi&aacute;pan that Kabkabaga-an loves Apon&#299;tolau and even if I make <i>dawak</i> we can do nothing, for Kabkabaga-an is one of the greatest spirits.&#8221; Not long after Apon&#299;tolau had become a very little man
and Ginal&#299;ngan stopped making <i>dawak</i>, and she went home to Pindayan. Apon&#299;tolau became like a hair. Not long after he disappeared. &#8220;You are good, Indi&aacute;pan, for
Apon&#299;tolau disappeared in your house.&#8221; So they cried together.

</p>
<p id="d0e4584">Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen went back home and Apon&#299;tolau was up in the air. He sat below a tree in a wide field, and he
looked around the field. Not long after he saw some smoke, so he went. As soon as he came near to the smoke he saw that there
was a house there. &#8220;I am going to get a drink,&#8221; he said. As soon as he arrived in the yard he said, &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Wes</span>,&#8221; for he was tired, and Kabkabaga-an saw, from the window of her house, that it was Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;Come up,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No,
I am ashamed to go up. Will you give me water to drink, for I am thirsty.&#8221; Kabkabaga-an gave him a drink of water. As soon
as he had drunk he sat down in the yard, for Kabkabaga-an could not make him go up. Not long after she went to cook. As soon
as she cooked she called Apon&#299;tolau and he said to her, &#8220;You eat first. I will eat with your husband when he arrives.&#8221; &#8220;No,
come up. I think he will arrive very late.&#8221; Not long after he went up, for he was hungry, and they ate. While they were eating
Kabkabaga-an said to him, &#8220;I have no husband and I live alone; that is why I brought you up here, for I love you.&#8221; Not long
after she became pregnant and she gave birth. &#8220;What shall we call the baby?&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;<a id="d0e4589src" href="#d0e4589" class="noteref">158</a> &#8220;Tabyayen.&#8221; Not long after the baby began to grow, for Kabkabaga-an used magic, so that he grew all the time, and every time
she bathed him he grew.

</p>
<p id="d0e4592">When the baby had become a young boy Kabkabaga-an said, &#8220;You can go home now, Apon&#299;tolau, for our son Tabyayen is a companion
for me.&#8221; &#8220;If you say that I must go home, I will take Tabyayen with me,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. She said, &#8220;We will tell my brother
Daldalip&aacute;to,<a id="d0e4594src" href="#d0e4594" class="noteref">159</a> who lives above, if you wish to take him.&#8221; So they went truly. As soon as they arrived where Daldalip&aacute;to lived, he said,
&#8220;How are you, Kabkabaga-an? What do you want?&#8221; &#8220;What do you want, you say. <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4597"></a>Page 115</span>We came to tell you that Apon&#299;tolau wants to take Tabyayen.&#8221; &#8220;Do you want to give him up to Apon&#299;tolau? If you let him go,
it is all right,&#8221; said Daldalip&aacute;to, and Kabkabaga-an said, &#8220;All right.&#8221; So they went home. As soon as they arrived where Kabkabaga-an
lived she commanded some one to make something of gold to hold milk for the boy to drink and she filled it with the milk from
her breasts. In the early morning she lowered her golden house by cords to the earth.

</p>
<p id="d0e4599">When it became morning Apon&#299;tolau awoke and he was surprised to see that they were in Kadalayapan. &#8220;Why, here is Kadalayapan.&#8221;
He went outdoors and Apon&#299;bolinayen also went outdoors. &#8220;Why, there is Apon&#299;tolau. I think he has returned from the home of
Kabkabaga-an.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen went to him and was glad to see him, and she took her son Kanag who looked the same as Tabyayen,
and they went to play in the yard. Apon&#299;bolinayen and Apon&#299;tolau did not know that they had gone to play. Not long after Tabyayen
cried, for the tears of Kabkabaga-an fell on him and hurt him, so Apon&#299;bolinayen went down to the yard and took them up into
the house.

</p>
<p id="d0e4601">Not long after Apon&#299;tolau said to Apon&#299;bolinayen, &#8220;We will make <i>balaua</i> and we will invite Kabkabaga-an. I think that is why the boy cried.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and they truly made <i>Sayang</i>. Not long after they made <i>L&#299;bon</i><a id="d0e4611src" href="#d0e4611" class="noteref">160</a> in the evening, and they commanded the spirit helpers to go and get betel-nuts. As soon as they arrived with the betel-nuts
Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen commanded, &#8220;You betel-nuts go and invite all our relatives and Kabkabaga-an.&#8221; So one of the
betel-nuts went to the place where Kabkabaga-an lived. As soon as it arrived up above it said, &#8220;Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen
of Kadalayapan want you to attend their <i>balaua</i>. That is why I came here.&#8221; Kabkabaga-an said, &#8220;Yes, I will follow you. You go first.&#8221; When it became afternoon all the people
from the other towns had arrived in Kadalayapan. When they looked under the <i>talagan</i><a id="d0e4622src" href="#d0e4622" class="noteref">161</a> they saw Kabkabaga-an, and Apon&#299;bolinayen went to take her hand, and they made her dance. As soon as she finished dancing
she told Apon&#299;bolinayen and Apon&#299;tolau that she would go back home. &#8220;No, do not go yet, for we will make <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> for Tabyayen first,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;No, you care for him. I must go home now, for no one watches my house.&#8221; Not long
after she went, for they could not detain her, and they did not see her when she went. As soon as the <i>Sayang</i> was over they made <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> for Kanag and Tabyayen, and Kanag married <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4637"></a>Page 116</span>Dapil&#299;san, and Tabyayen married Binaklingan, and the marriage price was the <i>balaua</i> about nine times full for each of them. As soon as they both were married Tabyayen staid in his house which had been up in
the air before. Kanag staid in another house which Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen had.

<p id="d0e4647">&#8220;Look out for our children, L&#299;g&#299;, while I wash my hair,&#8221; said Ayo. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;. As soon as Ayo reached the spring L&#299;g&#299;
went to make a basket, in which he put the three little pigs which had little beads around their necks. As soon as he made
the basket he put the three little pigs in it, and he climbed a tree and he hung the basket in it. Not long after he went
down and Ayo went back home from the well. &#8220;Where are our children&#8212;the little pigs&#8212;?&#8221;<a id="d0e4649src" href="#d0e4649" class="noteref">162</a> said Ayo to him. As soon as L&#299;g&#299; said he did not know, Ayo began to search for them, but she did not find them.

</p>
<p id="d0e4658">The little pigs which L&#299;g&#299; hung in the tree grunted, &#8220;G&#7431;k, g&#7431;k, g&#7431;k,&#8221; and the old woman, Alokot&aacute;n of Nagbotobot&aacute;n, went to
take a walk. While she was walking she stopped under the tree where the pigs hung. She heard them grunting and she looked
up at them and saw that the basket contained three pigs. &#8220;What man hung those little pigs in the basket in the tree? Perhaps
he does not like them. I am going to get them and take them home, so that I will have something to feed.&#8221; So she got them.
She took them home, and she named the older one Kanag, the second one Dumalaw&#299;, the third was Ogog&#299;beng.

</p>
<p id="d0e4660">Not long after the three little pigs, which had the beads about their necks, became boys, and Ogog&#299;beng was naughty. When
the old woman Alokot&aacute;n gave them blankets, he was the first to choose the one he wished. &#8220;Shame, Ogog&#299;beng, why are you always
the naughtiest and are always selfish.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, I always want the best, so that the girls will want me,&#8221; said Ogog&#299;beng. When
Alokot&aacute;n gave the belts, and clouts, and coats, he always took the best, and Kanag and Dumalaw&#299; were jealous of him, and they
said bad things. Ogog&#299;beng said to them, &#8220;I am not ashamed, for she is my mother, so I will take the best.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e4662">Not long after they were young men. &#8220;Mother Alokot&aacute;n, will you let us go to walk? Do not worry while we are gone, for we will
return soon,&#8221; said the three young men. The old woman said &#8220;yes&#8221; <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4664"></a>Page 117</span>and they went. They agreed on the place they should go, and Ogog&#299;beng said to them, &#8220;We will go where the young girls spin.&#8221;
Kanag and Dumalaw&#299; agreed, so they went. Not long after they arrived where the young girls were spinning. &#8220;Good evening, girls,&#8221;
they said. &#8220;Good evening,&#8221; they replied. &#8220;This is the first time you have been here, rich young men. Why do you come here?&#8221;
&#8220;We came to join you and get acquainted,&#8221; they said, and they talked. They waited for the girls to go home, but they did not
go. Not long after it became morning, and they did not wait any longer for the girls to go home, so they went away. As soon
as the three boys went home the young girls went to their homes also. Not long after they arrived where Alokot&aacute;n was and they
ate breakfast. As soon as they finished eating they went to take a walk again. Not long after they arrived in Kaodanan, in
the middle of the day. &#8220;Good morning, Aunt,&#8221; they said to Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. &#8220;Good morning, my sons,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;What do you
come here for, boys?&#8221; &#8220;What do you come here for, you say, Aunt; we come to take a walk, for we are anxious to see you,&#8221; they
said. &#8220;That is good. Where did you come from?&#8221; said Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. &#8220;We came from Nagbotobot&aacute;n where our mother Alokot&aacute;n lives.&#8221;
Not long after Apon&#299;gawan&#299; went to cook for them to eat. As soon as she cooked she fed them. So they ate. Not long after they
finished eating and they talked. After that it became night. When they had finished eating in the night they said, &#8220;We are
going back home, Aunt, but first we are going to the place where those young girls spin.&#8221; &#8220;No, I will not let you go back
to Nagbotobot&aacute;n now, for it is dark. If you are going to the place where the girls are spinning it is all right, but if you
are going home I will not let you go down from the house, for I fear you will be lost.&#8221; So the three young boys said to her,
&#8220;If you will not let us go back home tonight we will go tomorrow, but we will go where the young girls spin.&#8221; So Apon&#299;gawan&#299;
and Apon&#299;balagen let them go to where the girls were spinning.

</p>
<p id="d0e4666">Not long after they arrived at the place where the young girls were and they said, &#8220;Good evening, young girls.&#8221; &#8220;Good evening,&#8221;
answered the girls who were spinning. &#8220;Why do you come here, rich young men?&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;Why do you come here,&#8217; you say, we come to
see you spin and to talk with you.&#8221; Not long after they talked together, and the young men did not wait until the girls went
home, for it became morning, so they went back home. As soon as they went away, the young girls went home. When the boys reached
the house of Apon&#299;gawan&#299; and Apon&#299;balagen they told them they were going home to Nagbotobot&aacute;n. Apon&#299;gawan&#299; and Apon&#299;balagen
did not want to let them go until they had eaten breakfast. The three boys went even <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4668"></a>Page 118</span>though they did not want them to go. As soon as they reached Nagbotobot&aacute;n the old woman Alokot&aacute;n asked them where they had
been, and she was very angry with them. &#8220;Do not be angry with us, mother, for we want to take a walk; we were not lost.&#8221; &#8220;Where
did you go, then?&#8221; &#8220;We went to Kaodanan to see the pretty girls who never go out doors, but we did not find any. We found
some young girls spinning at night, but they were not as pretty as we wished, and we talked with them until morning, for we
wanted to see where they lived, but we could not wait for them to go back home.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e4670">Not long after the old woman Alokot&aacute;n went to cook. As soon as she finished cooking they ate. Not long after they finished
eating and they agreed to go at once to Kadalayapan. The old woman Alokot&aacute;n would not let them go, so when they finished eating
at night they went to Kadalayapan without her consent. As soon as they arrived at the place where the young girls were spinning
they said, &#8220;Good evening, young girls.&#8221; &#8220;Good evening,&#8221; the girls answered. &#8220;How are you? What do you want here?&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;What do
you want here,&#8217; you say, and we came to watch you spin and we want to talk with you.&#8221; So they talked until morning, but the
young boys could not wait until the girls went to their homes.

</p>
<p id="d0e4672">Ayo was still searching for the pigs who had become boys. She heard somebody say that three young boys were talking with the
girls last night and they said to her that they were pretty young boys. Ayo said, &#8220;Those were my sons. I think they have become
men.&#8221; So she went around the town looking for them. Not long after she met them and she saw that they were no longer little
pigs. &#8220;Where did you come from, my dear sons?&#8221; &#8220;We came from Nagbotobot&aacute;n, Aunt,&#8221; they answered. &#8220;Do not call me aunt, call
me mother,&#8221; said Apon=lbolinayen. The young boys would not call her mother. So Apon&#299;bolinayen pressed her breasts and the
milk from her breasts went into Kanag's mouth, and when she pressed again the milk went into the mouth of Dumalaw&#299;, and when
she pressed her breasts the third time the milk went to the mouth of Ogog&#299;beng. So Apon&#299;bolinayen was sure that they were
her sons. The little boys asked her why it was that the milk from her breasts went into their mouths. &#8220;I pressed my breasts
to make sure that you are my sons. I am surprised that you have become men, for you were little pigs. That is why you must
call me mother, not aunt. For a long time I have searched for you, and when I heard that you were talking with the young girls
last night, I came to look for you.&#8221; So the boys believed that she was their mother. &#8220;Why did we grow up in Nagbotobot&aacute;n with
our mother Alokot&aacute;n, if you are truly our mother?&#8221; &#8220;I think she found you and took you away, for she is a good <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4674"></a>Page 119</span>woman. She thought you were lost and took you to Nagbotobot&aacute;n.&#8221; So Apon&#299;bolinayen took them home.

</p>
<p id="d0e4676">As soon as they arrived home Apon&#299;bolinayen said to Apon&#299;tolau, &#8220;Here are our sons whom I found. They said that they came
from Nagbotobot&aacute;n and that Alokot&aacute;n was their mother. I told them that I was their mother, but they did not believe me.&#8221; &#8220;I
do not believe that they are our sons, for our children were three little pigs.&#8221; &#8220;I also had doubts when I met them, but I
pressed my breasts and the milk went to their mouths, so I am sure that they are our sons.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau was glad that they
were men, for he did not want them when they were pigs.

</p>
<p id="d0e4678">Not long after Apon&#299;tolau said to Apon&#299;bolinayen, &#8220;We are going to make <i>balaua</i>, so that we can invite all our relations in the other towns, especially Alokot&aacute;n.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen used magic, so that when
she put a grain of rice in each of twelve big jars they were filled.<a id="d0e4683src" href="#d0e4683" class="noteref">163</a> Not long after Apon&#299;tolau commanded his spirit helpers to go and get betel-nuts, to send to the relatives who lived in other
places, to invite them. As soon as one of the betel-nuts arrived in Nagbotobot&aacute;n it said, &#8220;Good afternoon, old woman Alokot&aacute;n.
I cannot stay long. Apon&#299;bolinayen and Apon&#299;tolau sent me to invite you to attend their <i>Sayang</i>&#8221;. &#8220;I cannot go, for I am searching for my three sons.&#8221; &#8220;If you do not come I will grow on your knee.&#8221; &#8220;You go first and I
will follow, but I cannot stay there long.&#8221; Not long after all the people from the other towns arrived and they danced until
the old woman Alokot&aacute;n arrived. The three young boys went to hide when Alokot&aacute;n arrived. Not long after when the <i>batana</i> was nearly finished, &#8220;I cannot wait until your <i>balaua</i> is finished, for I am searching for my three boys.&#8221; &#8220;Do not go home yet, for we will see if they will come here to see the
young girls. Perhaps they are near here,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. Not long after the three boys appeared to her and Alokot&aacute;n was
glad to see them. &#8220;Where have you been, my sons?&#8221; &#8220;We came to this town and we intended to go back to Nagbotobot&aacute;n, but our
mother Apon&#299;bolinayen saw us and she detained us, for she was sure that we are her sons. She pressed her breasts and the milk
came into our mouths.&#8221; The old woman Alokot&aacute;n was surprised and she went to Apon&#299;bolinayen and Apon&#299;tolau and talked with
them. &#8220;Are you sure those boys are your sons? They are my sons. They grew up with me.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, we are sure that they are my
sons, for the milk from my breasts went to their mouths. I am surprised that they have become men, for they were three pigs.
I searched for them a long time. That is why I was surprised <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4695"></a>Page 120</span>when I saw them, so I pressed my breasts.&#8221; &#8220;Why were you searching for them? Did someone else hang them in the tree?&#8221; said
Alokot&aacute;n. Apon&#299;bolinayen was surprised and she asked Apon&#299;tolau if he saw someone hang the little pigs in the tree while she
was washing her hair. Apon&#299;tolau laughed, &#8220;I did not see anyone get them.&#8221; One of the women had seen Apon&#299;tolau hang them
in the tree and she told Alokot&aacute;n that Apon&#299;tolau had hung them up. Alokot&aacute;n hated Apon&#299;tolau and she asked why he had hung
them in the tree. &#8220;I went to hang them up for I was ashamed, because they were not men but pigs.&#8221; &#8220;That is why you hung them
up. You have power. If you did not want them to be pigs you could change them to men. If I had not found them, perhaps they
would have died.&#8221; Not long after the <i>balaua</i> was finished, and the people went home, and the old woman Alokot&aacute;n went home after the others. She gave all her things to
the three boys. This is all.

<p id="d0e4705">Apon&#299;bolinayen and Apon&#299;tolau had a son and they called him Kanag Kabagbagowan, who was Dumalaw&#299; every afternoon. Soon he
became a young man and he went to make love to Apon&#299;tolau's concubines. When Apon&#299;tolau went where his concubines were he
said, &#8220;Open the door.&#8221; The women did not open the door, but answered, &#8220;We do not want to open the door unless you are Dumalaw&#299;.&#8221;
&#8220;Please open the door,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;<a id="d0e4707src" href="#d0e4707" class="noteref">164</a> to them. The women did not open the door, so he went back home and he was very angry. In the second night Apon&#299;tolau went
again. &#8220;Good evening, women,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Good evening,&#8221; said the women, and Apon&#299;tolau asked them to open the door. &#8220;You put
your hands into the door and let us see if the marks on the wrist are the marks on Kanag Kabagbagowan.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau showed
them his hands and they said, &#8220;You are not Kanag, but you are L&#299;g&#299;, and we do not wish you.&#8221; L&#299;g&#299; was very angry and he went
back home.

</p>
<p id="d0e4710">Five days later he said, &#8220;Sharpen your knife, Kanag, and we will go to cut bamboo.&#8221; So Kanag sharpened his knife. Not long after they went where many bamboo grew. As soon as they reached the place L&#299;g&#299; said,
&#8220;You go up and cut the bamboo and sharpen the ends.&#8221; L&#299;g&#299; cut the bamboo below him. As soon as L&#299;g&#299; had cut many bamboo he
asked Kanag if he had cut many, and Kanag said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8220;Did you sharpen the ends? If you pointed them, put them in one place.&#8221;
Kanag soon put them in one place. After that Apon&#299;tolau said to him, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4715"></a>Page 121</span>&#8220;Ala, my son, throw them at me so that we can see which is the braver of us.&#8221; &#8220;Ala, you are the first if you want to kill
me,&#8221; Not long after Apon&#299;tolau threw all the bamboo at Kanag, but did not hit him. &#8220;Ala, you are the next, my son,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau.
Kanag said, &#8220;No, I do not want to throw any at you, for you are my father and I am ashamed.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;If you do not
wish to throw at me we will go back home.&#8221; As soon as they arrived in Kadalayapan Kanag laid down in their <i>balaua</i>. When they called him at meal time he did not wish to go.

</p>
<p id="d0e4720">When Apon&#299;tolau and Apo=nibolinayen finished eating they said, &#8220;If you do not wish to eat we will go to see our little house
in the fields.&#8221; &#8220;We will go and fix it so we will have some protection during the rainy season,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. So they
went truly. As soon as they arrived at the little house in their farm, &#8220;Dig up the jar of <i>basi</i><a id="d0e4724src" href="#d0e4724" class="noteref">165</a> which I buried when I was a boy.&#8221; So Kanag dug up the <i>basi</i> which Apon&#299;tolau had made when he was a little boy. As soon as he had dug it up they drank it, and they put the <i>basi</i> in a big coconut shell. Apon&#299;tolau made his son drink a shell full of <i>basi</i>, so Kanag truly drank all of it. &#8220;Ala, dip again and I will drink next,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299; to him, and L&#299;g&#299; drank a shell cup of
<i>basi</i>. &#8220;Ala, dip again, we will drink three shell cups of this <i>basi</i>,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;. When Kanag had drunk the three shells of wine he was drunk and he slept. As soon as he was asleep, &#8220;What shall
I do now,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299; to himself. &#8220;The best thing for me to do is to send him away with the storm.&#8221; So he used his magical
power and soon the big storm came and took Kanag to Kalask&#299;gan while he was sleeping.

</p>
<p id="d0e4742">Not long after Apon&#299;tolau went back home to Kadalayapan. Apon&#299;bolinayen asked him where Kanag was. &#8220;I thought he came ahead
of me,&#8221; L&#299;g&#299; said. &#8220;I think you have killed him,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen, &#8220;for you think he loves your concubines.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau
went to lie down in their <i>balaua</i> and Apon&#299;bolinayen laid down in the house and their hair grew long along the floor, they laid so long.

</p>
<p id="d0e4747">Not long after Kanag awoke and he saw that he was in the middle of a field so wide that he could not see the edges of it.
&#8220;How bad my father is to me, for he sent me here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The best thing for me to do is to create people so that I will
have neighbors. I will use magic so that many betel-nut trees will grow in the middle of the field.&#8221; Not long after the betel-nut
trees bore fruit which was covered with gold. He took the betel-nuts and cut them in many pieces. In the middle of the night
he used his power and he said, &#8220;I will use magic and when I scatter all the betel-nuts which I have cut, they will become
women and men, who will be my neighbors tomorrow.&#8221;
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4749"></a>Page 122</span></p>
<p id="d0e4750">Not long after it became morning and he saw that he had many neighbors and he heard many people talking near to his house
and many roosters crowing. So Kanag was glad, for he had many companions. He went down the ladder, and he went where the people
were burning fires in the yards of their houses, and he went to see all of them. While he was visiting them he saw Dapili&#772;&#769;san
in the yard of her house and Kanag said to Bangan and Dalon&aacute;gan, &#8220;My Aunt Bangan and my Uncle Dalon&aacute;gan, do not be surprised,
for I want to marry your daughter Dapili&#772;&#769;san.&#8221; &#8220;If you marry our daughter, your father and mother will be greatly ashamed,&#8221;
said Dalon&aacute;gan. Kanag said to them, &#8220;My father and mother did not want me and they will not interfere.&#8221; So they were married.

</p>
<p id="d0e4752">&#8220;The best way for us to do, Dapili&#772;&#769;san, is for us to make <i>Sayang</i>&#8221; said Kanag. So Dapili&#772;&#769;san commanded someone to go and get the betel-nut fruit which was covered with gold. Not long after,
&#8220;Ala, you betel-nuts which are covered with gold come here and oil yourselves, and go and invite all the people to come and
attend our <i>Sayang</i>.&#8221; So the betel-nuts oiled themselves and they went to invite the people in the different towns. Not long after they went.
One of the betel-nuts went to Kadalayapan, and one went where Kanag's sweetheart lived. Some of them went to Pindayan and
Donglayan, which is the home of Iwaginan and Gimbangonan.

</p>
<p id="d0e4760">Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen was anxious to chew betel-nut. &#8220;I am going to chew. What ails me, for I am so anxious to chew?
I had not intended to eat anything while Kanag is away.&#8221; She looked up at her basket, and she saw that an oiled betel-nut,
which was covered with gold, was in it. She picked it up and tried to cut it. &#8220;Do not cut me, for I came to invite you, for
Kanag and his wife Dapili&#772;&#769;san sent me to summon you to their <i>Sayang</i> in Kalask&#299;gan,&#8221; said the betel-nut. Apon&#299;bolinayen was glad when she heard that Kanag was alive. So she got up and told all
the people of Kadalayapan to wash their hair so that they might attend the <i>Sayang</i> in Kalask&#299;gan. The people asked who was making <i>Sayang</i> in Kalask&#299;gan, and she replied that it was Kanag and his wife Dapili&#772;&#769;san. Not long after they washed their clothes and hair,
and took a bath. When it became afternoon they went and Apon&#299;tolau followed them, and he looked as if he was crazy. As soon
as they arrived at the river near the town of Kalask&#299;gan, Kanag saw them and there were many of them by the river. He sent
crocodiles and they went to take the people across the river. Apon&#299;tolau was the first who rode on one of the crocodiles and
the crocodile dived, so Apon&#299;tolau went back again to the bank of the river. Not long after Apon&#299;tolau's companions were all
on the other side of the river, and he was alone, for the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4771"></a>Page 123</span>crocodiles would not carry him across. He shouted as if crazy, and Kanag sent one of the crocodiles to get him. Not long after
one crocodile went where Apon&#299;tolau was, and he stood on its back and it took him to the other side of the river.

</p>
<p id="d0e4773">When they all sat down beside the river, Dalon&aacute;gan said, &#8220;What shall we use for the <i>alawig</i>,<a id="d0e4778src" href="#d0e4778" class="noteref">166</a> for your father and mother?&#8221; &#8220;The singed pig, for it is the custom of the people in Kadalayapan,&#8221; said Kanag to his mother-in-law.
&#8220;Go and get some of the pigs and singe them,&#8221; said Dalon&aacute;gan to him. Not long after he singed the pigs and he carried them
to the people, and his wife Dapili&#772;&#769;san carried one little jar which looked like a fist, filled with <i>basi</i>. As soon as the woman who was making <i>Sayang</i> had finished the <i>d&#299;am</i><a id="d0e4792src" href="#d0e4792" class="noteref">167</a> near by the well, Dapili&#772;&#769;san made the people drink the <i>basi</i> which she carried. Each person drank from a golden cup filled with <i>basi</i> from out of the little jar which looked like a fist, and one third of the <i>basi</i> in the jar was still left.<a id="d0e4807src" href="#d0e4807" class="noteref">168</a> As soon as the people drank they took them up to the town.

</p>
<p id="d0e4813">When they arrived in the town Apon&#299;bolinayen was anxious for them to chew betel-nut. So she gave some to Kanag and his wife
Dapili&#772;&#769;san and to some others. So they chewed and Kanag said to them, &#8220;You are first to tell your names.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;tolau
of Kadalayapan,&#8221; said the man who looked like he was crazy. &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;bolinayen.&#8221; As soon as they had told their names
Kanag was the next and he said, &#8220;My name is Kanag Kabagbagowan who was carried by the big storm.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Dapili&#772;&#769;san,
who is the daughter of Bangan and Dalon&aacute;gan, who is the wife of your son Kanag, for whom you did not make <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>. It is bad if you do not like the marriage.&#8221; &#8220;Our daughter, Dapili&#772;&#769;san, we like you, for Kanag wanted to marry you,&#8221; said
Apon&#299;bolinayen. Not long after the <i>balaua</i> was nearly finished, but the people were still dancing. &#8220;Now my <i>abalayan</i><a id="d0e4823src" href="#d0e4823" class="noteref">169</a> Dalon&aacute;gan, we are going to pay the marriage price according to the custom,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;Our custom is to fill the
<i>balaua</i> nine times with the different kind of jars.&#8221; So Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;Ala, you <i>alan</i><a id="d0e4834src" href="#d0e4834" class="noteref">170</a> who live in the different springs and <i>banan&aacute;yo</i><a href="#d0e4834" class="noteref">170</a> of Kaodanan and you <i>liblibayan</i>,<a href="#d0e4834" class="noteref">170</a> go and get the jars, <i>malayo</i> and <i>tadogan, sumadag</i> and <i>ginlasan</i> and <i>addeban</i> and <i>gumtan</i>, which Kanag must pay as the marriage price for Dapili&#772;&#769;san.&#8221; As soon as she had commanded they went, and they filled the
<i>balaua</i> nine times, and Apon&#299;bolinayen said to Dalon&aacute;gan, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4864"></a>Page 124</span>&#8220;I think now that we have paid the marriage price,&#8221; and Dolon&aacute;gan said, &#8220;No, there is more still to pay.&#8221; &#8220;All right, if we
still owe, tell us and we will pay.&#8221; So Dalon&aacute;gan called her big pet spider and said, &#8220;You, my pet spider, go around the town
of Kalask&#299;gan and spin a thread as you go, on which Apon&#299;bolinayen must string golden beads.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e4866">When the spider had put a thread around the town Dalon&aacute;gan said to Apon&#299;bolinayen, &#8220;Now, you put golden beads on the spider's
thread which surrounds the town.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen again commanded the <i>liblibayan, alan</i>, and the other spirits to go and get the golden beads. As soon as they secured the beads they put them on the thread which
surrounded the town. Not long after they arrived and they strung the beads on the thread. As soon as they finished, Dalon&aacute;gan
hung on the thread to see if it would break. Dapil&#299;san said, &#8220;Ala, you thread of the spider be strong and do not break, or
I shall be ashamed.&#8221; Truly, the thread did not break when Dalon&aacute;gan hung on it. &#8220;Ala, my <i>abalayan</i>, is there any other debt?&#8221; asked Apon&#299;bolinayen, and Dalon&aacute;gan said, &#8220;No more.&#8221; When the <i>balaua</i> was over the people who went to attend the <i>Sayang</i> went home, and Apon&#299;bolinayen said to Kanag, &#8220;Now, we will take you back to Kadalayapan,&#8221; and he replied, &#8220;No, for I wish to live here.&#8221; When they could not take him to Kadalayapan, Apon&#299;bolinayen said to Apon&#299;tolau,
&#8220;I am going to stay here with him,&#8221; but Apon&#299;tolau would not let her stay, but took her back.

<p id="d0e4888">Apon&#299;bolinayen went to the spring. As soon as she arrived there she washed her hair. When she washed her hair she dived into
the water, and she did not know that blood from her body was being washed away by the water.

</p>
<p id="d0e4890">&#8220;I am going to the spring,&#8221; said the <i>alan</i>, who was Inil-lagen. As soon as she arrived at the river she took her headaxe and scooped up the blood which was carried
by the stream and she went back to Dag&aacute;pan. As soon as she reached her house she put the blood on a big plate which was inherited
through nine generations, and she covered it.

</p>
<p id="d0e4895">&#8220;I am going to the well,&#8221; said Apon&#299;gawan&#299; of Natpangan. As soon as she arrived she burned rice straw, which had been inherited
nine times, and she put it in the pot with water. After that she took the water from the jar and put it in the coconut shell
and she washed her hair. As soon as she washed her hair she dived in the river, and she washed her arm beads which twinkled
in the evening, and she did not know that her blood was flowing and was being carried away by the stream.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4897"></a>Page 125</span></p>
<p id="d0e4898">&#8220;I am going to the well,&#8221; said the <i>alan</i> Apinganan who lived in Bagonan, and she saw the blood of Apon&#299;gawan&#299;, and she secured it on her headaxe, and she put it inside
of her belt. After that she went home. As soon as she arrived in her house she put the blood in the big dish, which had been
nine times inherited, and she covered it.

</p>
<p id="d0e4903">&#8220;I am going to uncover my toy,&#8221; said the <i>alan</i> Inil-lagen. &#8220;No do not uncover me, grandmother; I have no clout and belt,&#8221; said the little boy. So she gave him a clout and
belt and after that she uncovered it. &#8220;Ala, we will give him the name of Ilw&#299;san of Dag&aacute;pan,&#8221; said all the <i>alan</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e4914">&#8220;I am going to uncover my toy,&#8221; said the <i>alan</i> Apinganan. &#8220;No, do not uncover me, because I have no clout and belt,&#8221; said the little boy. So Apinganan gave him a clout
and belt and uncovered him. &#8220;Ala, there is no other good name, but Dondony&aacute;n of Bagonan.

</p>
<p id="d0e4919">&#8220;I am going to fight,&#8221; said Dondony&aacute;n of Bagonan. He took his headaxe, which was one span long, and he went to get Ilw&#299;san
of Dag&aacute;pan, and so Ilw&#299;san took his headaxe, which was one span long, and they went. As soon as they got out of the town they
began to strike their shields with a stick. The sound of the beating was as great as that made by one hundred. As soon as
Apon&#299;bolinayen heard the noise of the shields she shouted and Danay of Kabisilan shouted also, and those who shouted were
the ladies who always staid in the house.<a id="d0e4921src" href="#d0e4921" class="noteref">171</a> When they passed by the spring of Natpangan Apon&#299;gawan&#299; shouted. When they passed by Pinday&aacute;n, Gimbagonan shouted and the
world trembled while she shouted.

</p>
<p id="d0e4927">While they were walking they arrived at the spring of G&#299;amb&#333;lan of Kaboyboyan, who was an <i>alzado</i>.<a id="d0e4932src" href="#d0e4932" class="noteref">172</a> Not long after they reached the <i>alzado</i> woman at the spring, for she was still making <i>Sayang</i>. Not long after Ilw&#299;san of Dag&aacute;pan killed the tattooed <i>alzados</i>, who were more than one hundred, who were dipping water from the spring. &#8220;We go to the town,&#8221; said Ilw&#299;san of Dag&aacute;pan to
Dondony&aacute;n. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, and they went. As soon as they arrived in the town, G&#299;amb&#333;lan saw them and he was surprised, for
they were two boys who entered the town. &#8220;You little boys who come in my town, you are the first who ever came here,&#8221; said
G&#299;amb&#333;lan, who had ten heads. He went up into the house and the little boys said, &#8220;Take your headaxe and spear G&#299;amb&#333;lan;
although we are little boys we are not afraid of you, for we came here to fight with you. It is the last of your life now.&#8221;
&#8220;G&#299;amb&#333;lan, you first fight against us,&#8221; said Ilw&#299;san. He used his power. &#8220;You headaxe and spear of G&#299;amb&#333;lan, if he throws
you against us, do not strike us.&#8221; <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4947"></a>Page 126</span>When all the spears and headaxes of G&#299;amb&#333;lan were lost, the boys truly were not hurt. &#8220;Now we are next to throw our spears.
You, our headaxes, when we strike and throw the spear you pierce the side of G&#299;amb&#333;lan,&#8221; they said. Not long after G&#299;amb&#333;lan laid down. &#8220;You, my headaxe, cut off the heads of G&#299;amb&#333;lan at one blow,&#8221; they said. So the ten heads
were cut off. &#8220;You, my spear and headaxe, go and kill all the people in the houses of the town, who live with G&#299;amb&#333;lan,&#8221;
they said. The spears and headaxes went and killed all the people in the town, and the pig troughs were floating in blood
toward the river. &#8220;You, heads, gather together in the yard of G&#299;amb&#333;lan. You, heads of the women, separate, and you, heads
of G&#299;amb&#333;lan, go first, and you, storm, carry the house of G&#299;amb&#333;lan. You go near to our house in Dag&aacute;pan.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e4951">&#8220;I will tramp on the town of G&#299;amb&#333;lan so it will be like the ocean,&#8221; they said. Not long after the town was like the ocean.
They went home and they followed after the heads, which they sent first to their town. Not long after, &#8220;I use my power so
that we arrive at once in Dag&aacute;pan,&#8221; said Ilw&#299;san. So they arrived truly.

</p>
<p id="d0e4953">&#8220;All the heads of G&#299;amb&#333;lan stay by the gate of the town; all the heads of the people who live with him stay around the town.&#8221;


</p>
<p id="d0e4955">&#8220;You <i>alan</i> who look like me, we will go and see Ilw&#299;san and make him go into the house, for he has returned from fighting.&#8221; Not long
after they made him climb the <i>sangap</i><a id="d0e4962src" href="#d0e4962" class="noteref">173</a> so he could talk with the star, it was so high. Ilw&#299;san did not climb, but he jumped over the ladder and he did not touch
it. &#8220;You, <i>alan</i>, take down the <i>gansas</i> for we are going to have a big party, for we have come back from fighting.&#8221; So the <i>alan</i> took down the <i>gansas</i> and they danced. &#8220;You send your people to go and invite our relatives,&#8221; said Ilw&#299;san, &#8220;so that they will come to attend my
big party, for I have returned from the fight.&#8221; So they sent the messengers to the towns where the relatives lived.

</p>
<p id="d0e4980">When the spirit messengers arrived by the <i>balaua</i> where Apon&#299;tolau of Kadalayapan was lying down, &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; they said. &#8220;How are you,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;I came here because
Ilw&#299;san of Dag&aacute;pan sent me to get you, for they make a big party, for they have returned from fighting.&#8221; &#8220;This is the first
time I have heard of a town called Dag&aacute;pan,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;You people who live with me, come with me and we all will go
to Dag&aacute;pan, because Ilw&#299;san will make a big party, for he has returned from fighting; all you ladies who stay in the house
come also.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e4985">Not long after they went and Apon&#299;tolau guided them, and they met <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e4987"></a>Page 127</span>the people who live in Natpangan and Pindayan in the way. Gimbagonan, who was the wife of Iwaginan, and Danay of Kabisilan
went to Dag&aacute;pan. When they arrived at the spring of Ilw&#299;san of Dag&aacute;pan they all stopped. &#8220;We will all stop here and wait until
someone comes to meet us,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. Not long after Ilw&#299;san and Dondonyan saw all the visitors who were at the spring,
so they went to meet them. Each of them took a glass of <i>basi</i> and gave the drink to them. When they had all drank they took them up to the town. Not long after, when they arrived in the
town, they sat down, and Apon&#299;tolau and the other people took the <i>gansa</i>, and Iwaginan took the <i>alap</i><a id="d0e4997src" href="#d0e4997" class="noteref">174</a> and they danced first with Apon&#299;bolinayen. As soon as they finished dancing they took out of their belts the girls who never
go out doors, and they joined the people. The girl whom Apon&#299;bolinayen took out of her belt was Dalikn&aacute;yan, and the girls
whom Apon&#299;gawan&#299; took out of her belt were Indi&aacute;pan, and Alama-an, and the girl whom Danay of Kabisilan took out of her belt
was Asigtan&aacute;n, and the girl whom Gimbagonan took out of her belt was Dalonagan.<a id="d0e5003src" href="#d0e5003" class="noteref">175</a> As soon as they had taken the girls out they made them sit in one row and the circle of people was very bright, because of
the girls, for they were all pretty. After that Iwaginan made Dalikn&aacute;yan and Dalonagan and Alama-an and Asigtan&aacute;n dance with
Ilw&#299;san of Dag&aacute;pan. When they had danced across the circle five times they stopped. As soon as they finished dancing Iwaginan
made Apon&#299;tolau dance with Danay of Kabisilan. When Apon&#299;tolau stamped his feet as he was dancing all the fruit of the coconut
trees fell down. After they finished Balogagayan and Gimbagonan danced. After they danced Kabin-na-ogan of Kabitaulan danced
with Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. After they danced they went to eat. The food was of thirty different kinds, and they were abashed in the
golden house of Ilw&#299;san, which had many valuable jars in it, for the <i>alan</i> had given them to him.

</p>
<p id="d0e5012">As soon as they finished eating they gathered again, and the <i>alan</i> Kilagen told them that Ilw&#299;san was the son of Apon&#299;bolinayen, and Dondony&aacute;n was the son of Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. She said, &#8220;The reason
that we made your son come to life was that we might have someone to give our things to, for we have no children to inherit
them.&#8221; &#8220;If that is so we are going to change their names. Ilw&#299;san will be Kanag Kabagbagowan,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;Dondony&aacute;n
will be Dagol&aacute;yen, who is a rich man.&#8221; &#8220;Now it is two months since we came here and we go home,&#8221; they all said. As soon as
they agreed, the <i>alan</i> gave them <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5020"></a>Page 128</span>valuable things. Apon&#299;tolau used his power and the golden house of Kanag which the <i>alan</i> gave him was pulled up and went to Kadalayapan and the gold house of Dondony&aacute;n went to Natpangan. Apon&#299;gawan&#299; used her power,
and when it became morning Kanag cried because his golden house of Dag&aacute;pan, which was the <i>alan's</i> town, went to Kadalayapan. &#8220;Do not cry, Kanag; this is your town; we are your father and mother.&#8221; So Kanag stopped crying.


</p>
<p id="d0e5028">The next month Kanag said to his father and mother, &#8220;The best thing for you to do is to engage me to Dalikn&aacute;yan, who never
goes out doors, and there is no one to compare with her, who looks like the firefly in the evening, and her footprints are
loved by all the men, for they look like the rainbow.&#8221; Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen took the golden beads, which look like
the moon, to use as an engagement present. Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen and Apon&#299;tolau arrived at Kabisilan. &#8220;Good morning,
Aunt Danay,&#8221; they said. &#8220;How are you?&#8221; said Danay. &#8220;Come up and we will eat.&#8221; They went up the stairs, and Danay took the
rice out of the jar and took out the meat, and they ate. As soon as they finished eating, &#8220;We cannot stop here long, for we
are in a hurry,&#8221; and they showed her the gold which was like the moon, for they wished to make the engagement. Danay of Kabisilan
agreed, and they set a day for <i>pak&aacute;lon,</i> and it was three days later. Not long after they went back home. As soon as they arrived they told their son Kanag and he
was very happy.

</p>
<p id="d0e5033">When the day for <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> came they summoned all the people, and so they went, and some of them went first. &#8220;You, my jar, <i>bil&#299;bil&#299;,</i> and my jar <i>ginlasan</i>, and you my jar <i>malayo</i>, go first.&#8221; So all the jars preceded them, and they followed. Not long after they arrived. When all the people whom they
invited arrived, they fed them all. When they had all finished eating, &#8220;Now that we have finished eating we are going to settle
on the price. My <i>balaua</i> must be filled eighteen times with different jars before Kanag and Dalikn&aacute;yan can be married.&#8221; So they filled the <i>balaua</i> eighteen times. &#8220;Now that the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> is finished and we have paid the price, we will take her home, and you prepare the food for her to take.&#8221; So they started
to fix a box for her with pillows, and they gave her a golden hat which looked like a bird, and she put her skirt on her head
and it twinkled. Not long after they went. As soon as they arrived in Kadalayapan, they went upstairs, and they made her sit
on the bamboo floor, and they counted the bamboo strips on which she sat, and it was an arm span long of agate beads.<a id="d0e5058src" href="#d0e5058" class="noteref">176</a> Not long after they had a son and they named him Dumalawig. This is all.

<p id="d0e5070">&#8220;I am going to hunt deer with the dogs, mother,&#8221; said Kanag. &#8220;No, do not go, you will be lost,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;No,
I will not be lost. Give me provisions to take,&#8221; he said, and he fretted so his mother let him go, and she gave provisions,
for she could not prevent him from going. So he went.

</p>
<p id="d0e5072">&#8220;Ey-Ey-k&#333;ta, my puppy, Ey-Ey, my fat dog, do not catch anything until we reach the middle of the wood, which is the place
where the <i>anteng</i> tree grows.&#8221; Not long after while he was walking the puppy went into the jungle and it barked in the wood. He went to reach
it. When he arrived he saw that what the puppy barked at was a very small house by the resin tree. He went up to the house.
Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen went to hide under the hearth and Kanag did not go out of the house until the girl appeared. One
night had passed, then the girl who owned the house appeared. He saw that she was a beautiful girl and they talked. &#8220;It is
not good for us to talk until we know our names,&#8221; said Dumanau,<a id="d0e5077src" href="#d0e5077" class="noteref">177</a> and he gave her betel-nut, and she did not receive it, so he made it very good so that she wanted it after two days. After
that she received the betel-nut which was covered with gold. As soon as they chewed, &#8220;You first tell your name, for you live
here; it is not good for me to tell first, for I come from another place,&#8221; said Dumanau. &#8220;No, it is not good for a girl to
tell her name first. You are a boy and even though you came from another place you tell your name first,&#8221; said Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen.
&#8220;My name is Dumanau, who is the son of Apon&#299;bolinayen and Apon&#299;tolau of Kadalayapan.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen,
who is the daughter of an <i>alan</i> in Matawatawen.&#8221; When they put down their quids, they laid in good order as agates with no holes in them. &#8220;We are close relatives, and it
is good for us to be married.&#8221; So they married.

</p>
<p id="d0e5086">Three years passed. &#8220;The best thing is for us to take our house to Kadalayapan, and go there; perhaps my father and mother
are searching for me.&#8221; &#8220;No, we must not go, because I am ashamed, for they did not engage me to you,&#8221; said Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen.
&#8220;No, we go; we must not stay always in the jungle,&#8221; he said. So in the middle of the night Dumanau used his power. &#8220;I use
my magic so that this house we are in goes to Kadalayapan. You stand there by our house,&#8221; he said; so the little house went
there while they were asleep. The next morning Wanwanyen was surprised because many chickens were crowing and many people
were talking, and when she went to look out of the window there were many houses. &#8220;Why, Dumanau, it is not the jungle <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5088"></a>Page 130</span>where we are now; where are we?&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is the town of Kadalayapan.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e5090">Not long after their three children went to look out of the window and they saw the sugar cane, and they were anxious to chew
it. &#8220;Father, go and get the sugar cane for us to chew,&#8221; they said. Dumanau went, and he advised Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen to
fasten the door while he was gone. &#8220;If anyone comes do not open the door.&#8221; He went, and Dumanau's father and mother were frightened,
because the little house was by their dwelling, for there was no little house there before. As soon as Dumanau arrived in
the house of his father and mother they were surprised, for they had searched for him three years. They asked where he had
been, and he said he had found a wife in the wood when he had staid for three years. He told his mother that she must not
go to his house and say bad words to his wife. So Dumanau went to the place of the sugar cane, and his mother went to the
house and said bad words to his wife. &#8220;Open the door, you bad woman, who has no shame. You are the cause of my son being lost,
and we spent much time to find him. What did you come here for, worthless woman?&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen
did not answer her. Not long after Dumanau arrived at their house and Wanwanyen said to him, &#8220;It is true what I told you.
I told you not to go and you did truly, and your mother came and said many bad words. I said it was best for us to stay always
in Matawatawen, but you paid no heed. Now my stomach is sick, for your mother came here to say many bad things to us.&#8221; Not
long after she died. Dumanau sharpened his headaxe and spear, for he wanted to kill his mother, because she said bad things
to his wife Wanwanyen, but he did not kill her, because she fastened the door.

</p>
<p id="d0e5092">As soon as Dumanau arrived in their house he made a <i>tabalang</i><a id="d0e5096src" href="#d0e5096" class="noteref">178</a> of gold, and put the body of Wanwanyen inside of it, and he put a golden rooster on top of it. As soon as he finished he
put the body of Wanwanyen inside of it. As soon as he had done this he said, &#8220;If you pass many different towns where the people
get water, you rooster crow.&#8221; The rooster said, &#8220;Tatalao, I am <i>tabalang</i> of Kadalayapan; on top of me is a golden rooster.&#8221; He pushed the <i>tabalang</i> into the river and so it floated away. When it passed by the springs in the other towns, the rooster said, &#8220;Tatalao, I am
<i>tabalang</i> of Kadalayapan, and on top of me is a golden rooster.&#8221; That is what the rooster always said when they passed the springs
in the other towns.

</p>
<p id="d0e5111">Dumanau wandered about as if crazy, and his oldest son walked in front of him. He carried the next child on his back and carried
the third <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5113"></a>Page 131</span>on his hip. When the <i>tabalang</i> arrived in Nagbotobot&aacute;n, &#8220;Tatalao, I am <i>tabalang</i> of Kadalayapan, and on me is a golden rooster,&#8221; said the rooster on the <i>tabalang</i> which was made of gold. The old woman Alokot&aacute;n was taking a bath by the river and she was in a hurry to put on her skirt
and she followed the <i>tabalang</i>. &#8220;You <i>tabalang</i>, where did you come from? Are you the <i>tabalang</i> of Kapaolan? If you are not from Kapaolan, are you from Kanyogan?&#8221; The <i>tabalang</i> did not stop and it nearly went down into the hole where the stream goes.<a id="d0e5136src" href="#d0e5136" class="noteref">179</a> So Alokot&aacute;n ran very fast. &#8220;Are you <i>tabalang</i> from Kaodanan?&#8221; The <i>tabalang</i> hesitated a little. &#8220;Are you <i>tabalang</i> of Kadalayapan?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the <i>tabalang</i> and stopped; so she went inside of the <i>tabalang</i> and she took the body to her house. She was afraid of the <i>tabalang,</i> because it was made of gold and she was surprised because the woman who was inside was beautiful and there was no one to
compare with her. As soon as they arrived to her house, &#8220;I whip perfume <i>al&#299;kadakad</i> and make her wake up directly.&#8221; &#8220;I whip my perfume <i>banau&#7431;s</i> and directly she will say, &#8216;<span class="smallcaps">Wes</span>,&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;I whip my perfume <i>dag&#299;monau</i> and directly she will wake up entirely.&#8221;<a id="d0e5169src" href="#d0e5169" class="noteref">180</a> &#8220;How long I slept, grandmother,&#8221; said Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen. The old woman Alokot&aacute;n took her inside of the house. &#8220;&#8216;How
long my sleep,&#8217; you say, and you were dead. There is the <i>tabalang</i> they put you in and I was surprised, for it was made of gold and has a golden rooster on top of it. They used it to send
you down the river.&#8221; Not long after the old woman Alokot&aacute;n hid her, and Dumanau, who was always wandering about with his children,
approached the place where the women were dipping water from the spring. All the women who were dipping water from the well
said, &#8220;Here is a lone man who is carrying the babies. We agree that we all salute him at one time.&#8221; As soon as they agreed
Dumanau arrived to the place where they were dipping water and he said, &#8220;Good day, women.&#8221; &#8220;Good day also,&#8221; answered all the
women in unison. &#8220;Where are you going, lone man who is carrying the babies?&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;Where are you going,&#8217; you say, women. I am
following Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen whom I put inside the <i>tabalang</i> for she was dead. Did you see the <i>tabalang</i> pass here?&#8221; said Dumanau. &#8220;It passed by here long ago. Perhaps it is in Nagbotobot&aacute;n now.&#8221; &#8220;Ala, I leave you now, women,
and I go and follow.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the women.

</p>
<p id="d0e5184">While they were walking they arrived in Nagbotobot&aacute;n and Dumanau saw the <i>tabalang</i> in the yard by the house of Alokot&aacute;n and they <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5189"></a>Page 132</span>exchanged greetings. &#8220;Good afternoon,&#8221; they said, and Alokot&aacute;n took them upstairs; so they went up. Not long after while they
were talking, &#8220;This was my <i>tabalang</i>, my grandmother old woman Alokot&aacute;n; bring out of hiding Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen, so that I may take her home,&#8221; said Dumanau,
and the old woman Alokot&aacute;n did not bring her out because she did not believe that he was the husband of Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen;
so she used magic, and when she found that he was the husband of Wanwanyen she said, &#8220;She is over there. I hid her.&#8221; So she
went to get her and Dumanau, was joyful, for he saw Wanwanyen alive again. &#8220;Ala, now grandmother old woman Alokot&aacute;n, how much
must I pay, because you saved my wife Wanwanyen?&#8221; &#8220;That is all right, no pay at all. That is why I stay in this place so as
to watch and see if any of my dead relatives pass by my house and I make them alive again. If you were not my relative I would
have let her go.&#8221; So Dumanau thanked her many times and they went back home.

</p>
<p id="d0e5194">Not long after they arrived in Kadalayapan. &#8220;The best for us to do, Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen, is for us to build <i>balaua</i> and invite all of our relatives; perhaps you are not the daughter of an <i>alan,</i>&#8221; said Dumanau. &#8220;Why not? I am the daughter of the <i>alan,</i>&#8221; said Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;Ala, let us build <i>balaua</i> anyway.&#8221; Not long after they commanded people to pound rice, and as soon as Wanwanyen was ready she commanded someone to
go and secure the betel-nuts which were covered with gold. As soon as they arrived they oiled them. When it became evening
they made <i>L&#299;bon.</i><a id="d0e5210src" href="#d0e5210" class="noteref">181</a> The next morning they sent the betel-nuts to invite their relatives. So they went. Not long after, &#8220;I am anxious to chew
betel-nut. What is the matter with me?&#8221; said Apon&#299;gawan&#299;, who was lying down on her bed. As soon as she got up she found an
oiled betel-nut which was covered with gold beside her. &#8220;Do not cut me; I came to invite you to the <i>balaua</i> which Wanwanyen and Dumanau make,&#8221; said the betel-nut, when she took it intending to cut it. So Apon&#299;gawan&#299; told the people
of Kaodanan to start to attend <i>balaua</i> with Dumanau and Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen. She was surprised because Dumanau had arrived, for they had heard that he was
lost when he went to hunt deer. She said, &#8220;Perhaps he met a lady who never goes outdoors, who has power, when he went to hunt
deer.&#8221; Not long after, &#8220;Ala, you people who live in the same town, let us go now to Kadalayapan for Dumanau's and Wanwanyen's
<i>balaua</i>.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e5225">As soon as they arrived in the place where the people dipped water <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5227"></a>Page 133</span>from the spring they asked where the ford was. &#8220;You look for the shallow place,&#8221; said the people who were dipping the water.
Not long after they went across the river and some of the people who were dipping water went to notify the people making <i>balaua</i> that the visitors were there, so Dumanau and Wanwanyen went to the gate of the town and met them there and made <i>alawig</i>.<a id="d0e5235src" href="#d0e5235" class="noteref">182</a> Apon&#299;gawan&#299; and Apon&#299;bolinayen looked at the woman who was the wife of Dumanau and she was almost the same as Apon&#299;gawan&#299;.
As soon as they finished <i>alawig</i> they took them up to the town. While they were sitting, Apon&#299;gawan&#299; was anxious to know who Dumanau's wife really was, so
she went to Dumanau and said that they were going to chew betel-nut. &#8220;That is the best way to do so that we may know if we
are related,&#8221; said Dumanau. So they took the betel-nuts and divided them in pieces. &#8220;You tell your name first, because you
are the people who live here.&#8221; &#8220;No, my uncle, you old men are the first to tell your names.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;balagen, who
is the son of Pagatip&aacute;nan and Ebang of Natpangan, who is the brother of Apon&#299;bolinayen.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;tolau, who is the
son of Pagbok&aacute;san and Langa-an, who is the brother of Apon&#299;gawan&#299;, whose son is Dumnau.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Dumanau, who is the son
of Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen of Kadalayapan.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;gawan&#299; of Kaodanan, who is the wife of Apon&#299;balagen, who
has no sister.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Apon&#299;bolinayen of Kadalayapan, who is the wife of Apon&#299;tolau, whose son is Dumanau.&#8221; &#8220;My name
is Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen, who is the daughter of an <i>alan</i> of Matawatawen.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e5247">When they had told their names the quid of Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen went to the quid of Apon&#299;balagen and Apon&#299;gawan&#299; and Dumanau
laid down his quid. The quid of Dumanau went to those of Apon&#299;bolinayen and Apon&#299;tolau. &#8220;Now, Apon&#299;tolau, we know Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen
is our daughter; it is best for you now to pay the marriage price, nine times full the <i>balaua</i>,&#8221; said Apon&#299;gawan&#299; and Apon&#299;balagen. Apon&#299;bolinayen, the mother of Dumanau, begged the pardon of Dumanau and his wife, for
she did not know that his wife was the daughter of Apon&#299;gawan&#299; and Apon&#299;balagen, who was her brother. Not long after they
gave the marriage price. &#8220;I use my power so that the <i>balaua</i> of Wanwanyen and Dumanau is nine times filled,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen, and it was nine times filled with different kinds of
jars. Then Apon&#299;gawan&#299; raised her eyebrows and half disappeared, and Apon&#299;bolinayen used magic again and the <i>balaua</i> was full again. When they gave all the marriage price they danced. As soon as the dance was over they went to eat, all the
people whom they invited.
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5258"></a>Page 134</span></p>
<p id="d0e5259">When they finished eating Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen talked. &#8220;You, father and mother, you were not careful of your daughter.
I would not have heard any bad words if you had been careful.&#8221; &#8220;Ala, Wanwanyen-Apon&#299;bolinayen, that is our custom, because
we are related to the Kaboniyan and the <i>alan</i> always picks up some of us,&#8221; said her father and mother. &#8220;It is good that Dumanau found you, who is your husband. Apon&#299;bolinayen,
who talked bad before, is our relative. She is my sister,&#8221; said Apon&#299;balagen. &#8220;It is true that I said bad words to her, because
I did not know that we were related, though I am your relative; forgive me, daughter, your father is my brother,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen
to Wanwanyen. Not long after they drank <i>basi</i>, for they knew each other and made friends. As soon as they drank they danced during one month. When the <i>balaua</i> was finished all of the people went home and took some of the jars. As soon as they went home the father and mother-in-law
of Dumanau took all the other jars to Kaodanan. It is said.

<p id="d0e5275">&#8220;We are going away, Cousin Dagol&aacute;yan,&#8221; said Kanag. &#8220;If that is what you say we must go.&#8221; Not long after they went. As soon
as they reached the middle of the way they agreed upon their destination. &#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; they asked. &#8220;We are going
to the place Ginayod of Binglayan,&#8221; said Kanag. &#8220;Why are we going there?&#8221; said his cousin Dagol&aacute;yan. &#8220;We are going because
Ginayod of Binglayan has a pretty girl who never goes outdoors, and we are going to see her,&#8221; said Kanag.

</p>
<p id="d0e5277">Not long after they arrived where the young girls spun at night. &#8220;Stay here, Cousin Dagol&aacute;yan, and I will meet you here. I
am going to see the daughter of Ginayod, who is Asimb&aacute;yan of Ilang.&#8221; &#8220;If that is what you say it is all right,&#8221; said Dagol&aacute;yan.
Not long after Kanag reached the place where the girl was, and he talked with her. The girl who never goes outdoors said to
him, &#8220;If you will get the perfume of Baliw&aacute;n I will believe all you say.&#8221; &#8220;If you will agree to my mission I will go and get
whatever you want,&#8221; said Kanag. &#8220;Ala, if you do not believe me, you take my arm beads from my left arm, for you are kind to
go for me.&#8221; So she gave him her arm beads, and Kanag started to go at once. As soon as he arrived at the place where the young
girls spun and had joined his companion, his cousin asked, &#8220;What did she say?&#8221; &#8220;She told me that if I will secure the perfume
of Baliw&aacute;n she will do everything I ask of her. Let us both go.&#8221; &#8220;No, I do not wish <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5279"></a>Page 135</span>to go with you, for you will not go with me where I wish to go.&#8221; &#8220;Please come with me and another time I will go with you,&#8221;
said Kanag.

</p>
<p id="d0e5281">Not long after they went and they met the <i>doldoli</i><a id="d0e5285src" href="#d0e5285" class="noteref">183</a> in the way. &#8220;Where are you going, rich young men?&#8221; it said to them. &#8220;Where are you going,' you say, and we are going to get
the perfume of Baliw&aacute;n, for though we are far from it still we can smell it now.&#8221; &#8220;Ala, young men, you cannot go there, for
when anyone goes there, only his name goes back to his town.&#8221; But the boys replied, &#8220;We are going anyway. That is the reason
we are already far from home, and it is the thing the pretty girl wants.&#8221; &#8220;If you say that you are going anyway, you will
repent when you reach there.&#8221; &#8220;It is the thing which will make the girls love us.&#8221; So they left the jar and walked on. When
they reached the middle of the jungle they met a big frog, and it said, &#8220;Where are you going, young men?&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;Where are we going,&#8217;
you say, and we are going to get the perfume of Baliw&aacute;n, for that is what Asimb&aacute;yan of Ilang desires.&#8221; &#8220;No, do not go there,
for everyone who has gone there has died.&#8221; &#8220;We will go on anyway, for we are already far from our town and we cannot return
without the perfume.&#8221; So they left the frog and walked on. Not long after they approached the place where the perfume was,
and while they were still a long way off they could smell its odor. &#8220;What a fine odor it has. That is why the young girl who
never goes outdoors desires it so much.&#8221; They walked on and in a short time they reached the place below the perfume. When
they were there Dagol&aacute;yan said to Kanag, &#8220;Take some from the lower branches.&#8221; &#8220;No, it is better for me to climb and get some
from the top, for I think they are better above than below.&#8221; So Kanag climbed and as soon as he broke off the stem which held
the perfume his legs became like part of a snake. Dagol&aacute;yan looked up and he saw that the legs of his companion had changed
to part of a snake. He said, &#8220;Now, my Cousin Kanag, I am going to leave you, for you are no longer a man, but you are a serpent.&#8221;
&#8220;Do not leave me even if I do become a serpent. I will not injure you. Do not be afraid.&#8221; In a short time all his body had
become a real serpent, and Dagol&aacute;yan ran and went home, and the big serpent followed him.

</p>
<p id="d0e5288">Not long after Dagol&aacute;yan arrived in Kadalayapan, and Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen asked where Kanag was. &#8220;Kanag has become
a big serpent. As soon as he broke off the perfume of Baliw&aacute;n which the young girl desired he became a serpent.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau
and Apon&#299;bolinayen went around the town and told the people that they must accompany them, for they were going to see if Kanag
had really <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5290"></a>Page 136</span>become a serpent. When Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen had killed many animals and given much food to the searchers and they
did not find him, they stopped searching.

</p>
<p id="d0e5292">Not long after Kanag thought he would go to the river where the people took their baths. So he went. Not long after Langa-ayan
was anxious to wash her hair, so she went to the river and washed it, and Do-ansowan washed his hair first and Langa-ayan
helped him, for he was her husband. As soon as she had washed his hair, he said to her, &#8220;I am going to the town.&#8221; So he went
and left Langa-ayan alone by the river washing her hair. When she had washed her hair she washed her arm beads. While she
was washing her upper arm beads she heard a great commotion in the river, and soon after a big serpent appeared on the other
bank. Langa-ayan saw that it was a big serpent and she was so frightened that she started to run, but the serpent said to
her, &#8220;Do not run, my aunt, I am not a real serpent, for I was a young boy before.&#8221; So Langa-ayan stopped and asked him why
he had become a great serpent. &#8220;Because I went to Ilang to see the pretty girl, and she told me that if I could get the perfume
of Baliw&aacute;n she would do whatever I asked, so I went. I did not want to go, for I was not sure that she told the truth, but
she gave me her left bracelet, so I went. When I was still far away from Baliw&aacute;n I could smell the perfume, and when I reached
the tree I climbed it and I tried to break the stem which held the perfume, and my companion saw that I was changing to a
serpent and he ran away. I truly became a serpent and now I have come here and have met you. If you do not believe that I
was truly a boy, I will show you the arm beads.&#8221; So he lifted his head and Langa-ayan truly saw the arm beads around his neck.
&#8220;My aunt, will you find out how I may become a man again?&#8221; She said, &#8220;If what you have said is true you follow me.&#8221; So they
went up to the town.

</p>
<p id="d0e5294">Do-ansowan said to his wife, &#8220;How long you have staid at the river, my wife.&#8221; &#8220;I was there a long time, for I met a big serpent.
If you wish to see it, it is in the yard. He says he was a young boy and he showed me the arm beads of a young girl, which
he has about his neck. I believe that he is a young boy who has become a serpent. When he broke the stem of the perfume which
the girl wanted he became a serpent. He wants to know how he can again become a boy.&#8221; &#8220;Ala, if that is what he wants, you
go and take him to my Uncle Ma-obagan.&#8221; So they went and when they arrived where Ma-obagan lived she said, &#8220;Good morning,
uncle.&#8221; &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;The reason I came is because a young boy who became a big snake is here. Will you please
put him in your magic well which changes everything which goes in it and make him a young boy again?&#8221; &#8220;If he will go into
<span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5296"></a>Page 137</span>the water, even if it feels bad, you call him and let him go in.&#8221; So they went and when they arrived at the well the serpent
went into the water, and the serpent's skin began to crack and fall off and he became a boy again.

</p>
<p id="d0e5298">Not long after they went back to the house of Langa-ayan. As soon as they arrived there the boy went to the <i>balaua</i> and did not follow Langa-ayan to the house. Do-ansowan saw that he was a handsome young boy. As soon as Langa-ayan had finished
cooking they called him to come and eat and he said to them, &#8220;I do not wish to eat if there are no girls to eat with me.&#8221;
&#8220;We are afraid if you do not eat, for you did not eat for a long time, while you were a serpent.&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;Even though
I did not eat while I was a serpent I will follow my custom, for I do not eat unless a pretty young girl who never goes outdoors
eats with me.&#8221; When they could not persuade him Do-ansowan said to his wife, &#8220;Go and call our daughter Amau.&#8221; Not long after
she went to call her. When she arrived where they had put her she said, &#8220;Come and eat with the rich young man.&#8221; &#8220;How can I
go? I do not know how to walk.&#8221; &#8220;Take the big gold basket and hold on to it while you walk.&#8221; Not long after she arrived where
the food was, and Langa-ayan and Do-ansowan said to the boy who was still in the <i>balaua</i>, &#8220;Come and eat now, nephew, with our daughter who never goes outdoors.&#8221; So the boy went quickly, and when he reached the
place where the girl was, they ate. When they had finished eating he said that he was sick, but he was not. So they went to
fix a place for him to lie and he said, &#8220;Perhaps I am sick because of the spirit of the young girl.&#8221; So they went to call
their daughter, for Kanag wanted her to touch him, and he wanted to see her. The girl went to touch his body and he was all
right, for he wished her to touch him, and he said, &#8220;Now, my uncle and aunt, if you wish me for a son-in-law I wish to marry
Amau. I will not go any further to find a wife.&#8221; The father and mother of the girl agreed to what Kanag said, for the girl
wanted to marry him, so they were married.

</p>
<p id="d0e5306">&#8220;Now, Kanag, we are going to make <i>Sayang</i> and invite your mother and father so that they can see that you are a young man again,&#8221; said his father-in-law and mother-in-law.
They made <i>Sayang</i> and they sent someone to invite their relatives, and someone went to Asimb&aacute;yan of Ilang and told her that Kanag Kabagbagowan,
who lived in Kalaskigan, and his wife Amau were making <i>Sayang</i>. Some of the betel-nuts which they sent arrived in Kadalayapan where Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen lived and they said, &#8220;Good
morning,&#8221; to Apon&#299;tolau who was lying down in the <i>balaua</i>. He felt badly because Kanag was a serpent and he said to the betel-nut, &#8220;Good morning. Come to Kalaskigan, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5322"></a>Page 138</span>for Kanag and Amau are making <i>Sayang</i> and they want you to come.&#8221; So Apon&#299;tolau got up quickly and told Apon&#299;bolinayen who was lying down in the house that Kanag
and his wife were making <i>Sayang</i>, and they were happy because Kanag was a boy again. They told all the people to prepare to go to the <i>Sayang</i> of Kanag and his wife. So they went, and when they arrived they saw that Kanag was handsomer than before, and Asimb&aacute;yan went
also, for they had invited her. Asimb&aacute;yan saw that Kanag was the boy who had taken her bracelet and had gone to get the perfume
for her, and while she was watching him Kanag went to talk with her. He told her what had happened when he went to get the
perfume for her, and he told her how he had become a snake and his mother-in-law had met him by the river and had taken him
to the old man who changed him again to a boy, and he had married the daughter of Do-ansowan and Langa-ayan. Kanag said, &#8220;Now,
I cannot marry you, so I will give back your bracelet.&#8221; So he gave it back.

</p>
<p id="d0e5333">Not long after Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen asked how much they must pay for the wife of Kanag, and Langa-ayan and Do-ansowan
said, &#8220;Fill our <i>balaua</i> nine times with valuable things.&#8221; When they had paid all, they said, &#8220;Now we are going to take them to Kadalayapan, for we
have paid all you asked.&#8221; &#8220;No, do not take them. They are going to stay here,&#8221; said Do-ansowan and Langa-ayan. &#8220;They will
come there bye and bye.&#8221; &#8220;Ala, if that is what you say they must come and visit us, even if they stay here.&#8221; Not long after
Kanag and his wife went to Kadalayapan to visit his father and they staid there three months. Then Do-ansowan and his wife
were anxious for them to return. When Kanag and his wife returned to Kalaskigan they said, &#8220;Why did you stay so long? We thought
you were going to live in Kadalayapan and we intended to follow you.&#8221; &#8220;We staid a long time, for my father and mother would
not let us return when we wished,&#8221; said Kanag.

<p id="d0e5343">&#8220;Goto watch our <i>langpadan</i>,<a id="d0e5348src" href="#d0e5348" class="noteref">184</a> Kanag, because the wild pigs spoil it.&#8221; Kanag went. When he arrived at the field he went around it and it was not injured,
so he went to the little watch house and he was sorrowful, and he always hung his head. Not long after Apon&#299;tolau said to
Apon&#299;bolinayen, &#8220;Cook some rice and meat for I am going to our field and carry the food to Kanag.&#8221; So Apon&#299;bolinayen went
to cook. As soon as she finished cooking they ate first. As soon as they finished eating <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5351"></a>Page 139</span>Apon&#299;tolau took the rice and meat and started for the field where their son was. When Apon&#299;tolau appeared Kanag took his <i>l&#299;p&#299;</i> nuts and he played, and the mountain rice which he went to watch was not injured. As soon as Apon&#299;tolau arrived to the place
where he was playing, &#8220;Come to eat, Kanag,&#8221; and Kanag said, &#8220;I am not hungry yet. Put the food in the house. I will play awhile
first.&#8221; When Apon&#299;tolau could not make him eat he put the provisions in the house, and he went home and left the boy. Kanag
did not go and eat. The next morning Apon&#299;tolau went to take him food again and as soon as Kanag saw him he took his game
and went to play. When Apon&#299;tolau arrived he called him to go and eat, but he did not go for he wished to play, and he asked
his father to put the rice and meat in the house. Apon&#299;tolau was surprised, because he did not eat, and the provisions for
the first day were still untouched. He asked, &#8220;Why do you not like to eat?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;I am not hungry yet.&#8221; When Apon&#299;tolau
could not make him eat he went home again, and Kanag used magic and he became a <i>lab&#7431;g</i>.<a id="d0e5359src" href="#d0e5359" class="noteref">185</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e5362">Apon&#299;tolau said to Apon&#299;bolinayen, &#8220;I wonder why Kanag does not like to eat.&#8221; &#8220;I think he is sorrowful, because he was sent
to watch the mountain rice.&#8221; &#8220;What is the reason that you sent him to the field when the fences are strong and no wild pigs
can get in,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;You must cook and we will eat, and then I will go and get him.&#8221; Apon&#299;bolinayen went to
cook. As soon as she finished cooking they ate and after that Apon&#299;tolau took some rice and meat for Kanag to eat. Apon&#299;bolinayen
said to him, &#8220;As soon as he finishes eating bring him home. Do not let him stay there alone. That is why he does not wish
to eat.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and so he went. When he arrived at the field he could not see Kanag any more. He called to
him, and the little boy answered him from the top of the bamboo tree. His father felt very sorry that he had become a little
bird. &#8220;Why did you become a little bird, Kanag? Come and eat. I will not send you here any more.&#8221; Kanag said, &#8220;I do not wish
to eat and I would rather be a bird and carry the signs to everyone.&#8221; So his father went back home and he was sorrowful. As
soon as Apon&#299;tolau arrived in Kadalayapan he said to Apon&#299;bolinayen, &#8220;Kanag has become a bird. Perhaps he felt sorry because
we sent him to watch the rice. He said that when I am going to war he will fly over me, and he will give me the good and bad
signs.&#8221;<a id="d0e5364src" href="#d0e5364" class="noteref">186</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e5370">Not long after Apon&#299;tolau started out to fight. He took his spear, headaxe and shield, and he went. When he was near the gate
of the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5372"></a>Page 140</span>town, Kanag gave the bad sign. &#8220;Go back, father, for you have a bad sign,&#8221; said the little bird. So his father went back at
once. The next morning he started again and he went. When he reached the gate of the town the little bird gave him a good
sign, so he went. The little bird flew near to him and he always gave the good sign. Apon&#299;tolau was happy for he knew that
nothing would injure him.

</p>
<p id="d0e5374">Not long after they arrived at the <i>alzado</i><a id="d0e5378src" href="#d0e5378" class="noteref">187</a> town, and the <i>alzados</i> were glad when they saw Apon&#299;tolau and they said to him, &#8220;You are the only man who ever came to our town. Now you cannot
return home. We inherit you,&#8221; said the bravest of them. &#8220;Ala, if you say that I cannot go back home, you summon all the people
in your town, for we are going to fight,&#8221; said Apon&#299;tolau, and the <i>alzado</i> said to him, &#8220;You are very brave if you wish to fight with all of us.&#8221; So the bravest summoned all the people to prepare,
for Apon&#299;tolau wished to fight all of them. The people were surprised that one man wished to fight with them, and they said
to Apon&#299;tolau, &#8220;One of my fingers will fight with you. Don't say that you will fight with all of us.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau replied,
&#8220;Do whatever you wish. I still want to fight you.&#8221; The <i>alzados</i> were angry. The bravest of them ran toward Apon&#299;tolau, and he threw his spear and headaxe and Apon&#299;tolau jumped. The <i>alzados</i> were surprised, for he jumped very high, and they all began to throw their spears at him, and they ran and tried to cut his
head off. Apon&#299;tolau jumped and he secured all their spears and headaxes, and he said to them, &#8220;Am I the next now?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,
because we are now unarmed.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e5396">Apon&#299;tolau used magic so that when he threw his spear it would fly among them until they were all dead. When he threw his
spear it flew to all the <i>alzados</i> and killed all of them; so Apon&#299;tolau again used magic, and his headaxe cut off the heads of the <i>alzados</i>, and Apon&#299;tolau sat by the gate of the town. The little bird flew by him and said, &#8220;The good sign which I gave to you, father,
was all right and you have killed all the enemies.&#8221; Apon&#299;tolau said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; As soon as the headaxe had cut off all the heads
from the dead <i>alzados</i>, he used his power again so that all of the heads went to Kadalayapan. The heads went first and he followed them, and the
little bird always followed him.

</p>
<p id="d0e5407">As soon as they arrived at the gate of the town the little bird flew away and Apon&#299;tolau used magic so that the heads were
stuck around the town. As soon as the heads were placed around the town, Apon&#299;tolau commanded all the people in his town to
go and invite the people who lived in different places to come and attend his big party. He told them to invite all the pretty
girls who never go outdoors. So the people <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5409"></a>Page 141</span>went all over the world to invite the people to attend the party. As soon as the people arrived in Kadalayapan they played
the <i>gansas</i> and danced and Apon&#299;tolau said to Kanag, &#8220;Come down, Kanag. Do not stay always in the tops of trees. Come and see the pretty
girls and see if you want to marry one of them. Come and get the golden cup and put <i>basi</i> in it, and make them drink.&#8221; The little bird said, &#8220;I prefer to stay in the trees and make the signs when anyone goes to
fight.&#8221; When Apon&#299;tolau could not make him become a boy and come down he felt very sorry.

</p>
<p id="d0e5417">When the party was over all the people whom they invited went home and Kanag said to his father, &#8220;Now that your party is over
and the people have gone, I will go down and get the fruit of the trees to eat.&#8221;<a id="d0e5419src" href="#d0e5419" class="noteref">188</a> Apon&#299;bolinayen said to him, &#8220;My dear little son, do not go down and eat the fruit of the trees; we have all we need here.
Forgive your father and me, we will not send you again to the field.&#8221; Kanag did not pay attention and he started to go down.
So Apon&#299;bolinayen and Apon&#299;tolau commanded the spirit helpers. &#8220;Go and follow Kanag wherever he goes, so that he has companions;
do not leave him. Find a pretty girl for him so that he will not go down.&#8221; Not long after they overtook Kanag in the forest
and they all sat down and they said to him, &#8220;Wait here for us a minute, Kanag, while we find a toy for you.&#8221; &#8220;No, I do not
wish a toy; I am going down and eat the fruit of the trees.&#8221; &#8220;No, please wait for us. It is very near; we will be back soon.
If you do not care for any, you will see. Wherever you go we shall accompany you.&#8221; Kanag answered to them, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and they
went. As soon as they arrived at the well they used their power so that all the pretty girls who never go outdoors felt very
hot, so that they all came to the well to bathe.

</p>
<p id="d0e5425">Not long after the pretty girls went to the well in the early morning, and their parents did not know about it. As soon as
the pretty girl arrived at the well the helpers saw the girl who appeared like the flame of fire about the betel-nut blossoms.
As soon as they saw her washing her hair, they went back in a hurry where Kanag was waiting. &#8220;Kanag, come and hurry and see
the pretty girl.&#8221; Kanag said, &#8220;I do not wish to see her. I am going down to eat the fruit of the trees,&#8221; and they said again,
&#8220;Please come; it is very near. If you do not like her we will go wherever you wish.&#8221; So Kanag went with them, and when they
arrived he flew to the top of the betel-nut tree, and he saw the pretty girl, and he flew to another betel-nut tree above
her. &#8220;What can I do, if I become <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5427"></a>Page 142</span>a man now? I have no clothes and headband.&#8221; The helpers said, &#8220;Do not worry about that. Your father and mother told us to
give you whatever you wish, and we have everything here.&#8221; So Kanag went down and took the clothes and headband and he became
a man. He went and sat on the girl's skirt and she said, &#8220;Do not harm me. If you are going to cut me, do it only in one place
so there will not be so much to heal.&#8221; &#8220;If I was an enemy I would have killed you at once.&#8221; Kanag went to her and handed the
skirt to her. Not long after he gave her betel-nut and they chewed. As soon as they chewed they saw that it was good for them
to marry, for they both had magical power and Kanag told his name first and said, &#8220;My name is Kanag Kabagbagowan, who is the
son of Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen of Kadalayapan, who did not like him, and they sent him to watch their mountain rice,
and he became a bird which is a <i>lab&#7431;g</i>.&#8221; &#8220;My name is Dapili&#772;&#769;san, who is the daughter of Bangan and Dalon&aacute;gan of Kabn&#333;-angan.&#8221; After that the girl was in a hurry
to go home, for she was afraid her father and mother would see her, for they did not know that she had gone to the well. She
did not want Kanag to go with her to the town, but he did not want to leave her, and the sun shone in the east. The girl went
home and Kanag followed her.

</p>
<p id="d0e5432">Not long after they approached the town and Bangan was in the yard of their house, and Dalon&aacute;gan was looking out of the door.
Not long after she saw them. &#8220;What is the matter with Dapili&#772;&#769;san? A boy is with her as she returns from the well,&#8221; said Dalon&aacute;gan.
Bangan was surprised and he did not believe it, for their daughter never went outdoors. &#8220;If you do not believe it, look at
them; they are coming here,&#8221; she said. So Bangan turned and saw them. As soon as they arrived where Bangan sat, &#8220;Good morning,
uncle,&#8221; said Kanag. &#8220;Do not be surprised because I am with your daughter, for I am to be married to her. My father and mother
sent me to our rice field and left me there alone, and I was sorry that they did not like me, so I became a bird which gives
the sign to those who go to war. When my father went to fight I went with him, and he killed all the <i>alzados</i> in one town and he invited all the people in the world to his party to see if any of the young girls pleased me, but I do
not think they came here. I did not like to go to the pretty girls who attended the party, so I started to go down to eat
the fruit of the trees, but they sent their spirit helpers to follow and take care of me. When I was in the wood the helpers
met me and said &#8216;Wait for us here while we go to find you a toy,&#8217; and I scarcely waited, but finally waited, and they made
all the pretty girls go to the well, for they felt hot, so your daughter Dapili&#772;&#769;san went to take a bath. When the helpers
saw her they came to tell me and I did not wish to go, but they <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5437"></a>Page 143</span>compelled me. As soon as I saw her I thought it was good for me to marry her, so I became a man and came home with her. If
you wish me for a son-in-law I will be very happy.&#8221; Bangan and Dalon&aacute;gan said to him, &#8220;I wondered why my daughter went to
the well. I did not believe that Dapili&#772;&#769;san was there, and I am afraid that your father and mother will not like our daughter
Dapili&#772;&#769;san, for they did not send an engagement present to us.&#8221; Kanag said to him, &#8220;This is why I came here, and they sent
their spirit helpers with me to find a pretty girl to marry, so I will not go down. They will be glad when they know that
I am here and want to marry your daughter.&#8221; So Bangan and his wife sent someone to call Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen, and
to tell them that Kanag was in Kabn&#333;-angan. Before the messenger arrived in Kadalayapan Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen knew
that Kanag was in Kabn&#333;-angan, for the spirit helpers went to them when Kanag went with the girl to the town. Apon&#299;bolinayen
and Apon&#299;tolau were ready to go to Kabn&#333;-angan before the messenger arrived in Kadalayapan. They went there directly, and
they took many things to be used in the wedding.

</p>
<p id="d0e5439">As soon as they arrived in Kabn&#333;-angan they were glad to see that Kanag was a man again. Bangan and his wife asked if they
liked Dap&iacute;li&#772;&#769;san as a daughter-in-law, and they replied, &#8220;It is all right for Kanag to marry Dap&iacute;li&#772;&#769;san. We are glad he
found her and did not go down, and remain always a bird.&#8221; So they agreed on the marriage price, and Bangan and his wife said,
&#8220;The <i>balaua</i> nine times full of different kinds of jars.&#8221; As soon as the <i>balaua</i> was filled nine times Dalon&aacute;gan raised her eyebrows and half of the jars vanished, and Apon&#299;bolinayen used her power and
the <i>balaua</i> was filled again, so it was full truly and Dalon&aacute;gan said to Apon&#299;bolinayen, &#8220;The web of the spider will be put around the
town and you put golden beads on it, and if it does not break Kanag can marry Dapili&#772;&#769;san.&#8221; When Apon&#299;bolinayen had put the
golden beads on the web, Dalon&aacute;gan said again, &#8220;I am going to hang on the thread and if I do not break it the sign is good
and Kanag and his wife will not separate.&#8221; When she hung on the thread and it did not break they allowed Kanag to marry Dap&iacute;li&#772;&#769;san.
After that they played on the <i>gansas</i> and they danced. When they had danced all the guests took some jars before they went home. As soon as the people went home,
Apon&#299;tolau and Apon&#299;bolinayen took Kanag and his wife to Kadalayapan. This is all.

<p id="d0e5458">&#8220;I am going to take a bath,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;, so he went. &#8220;I am going to take a bath,&#8221; said Gamayaw&aacute;n also. As soon as she arrived
in the <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5460"></a>Page 144</span>river she went to bathe and L&#299;g&#299; took a bath further down the stream, and he put his <i>balangat</i><a id="d0e5464src" href="#d0e5464" class="noteref">189</a> on the bank, and it flew and alighted on the skirt of Gamayaw&aacute;n. Not long after Gamayaw&aacute;n went in a hurry to seize it. &#8220;Here
is my toy,&#8221; she said, and she put on her skirt, and L&#299;g&#299; was sorrowful, and he went home.

</p>
<p id="d0e5467">As soon as L&#299;g&#299; arrived by his house he went at once to the <i>balaua</i> and laid down in it and his mother saw him from the window. &#8220;What are you so downcast for? Why do you lie on your stomach?&#8221;
said his mother. &#8220;Why are you downcast for, you say, my mother; my <i>balangat</i> is lost,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do not grieve; it will appear bye and bye,&#8221; said his mother.

</p>
<p id="d0e5475">When Gamayaw&aacute;n arrived in her town of Magsiliwan: &#8220;You <i>alan</i> who live with me, look at my toy which I found by the river,&#8221; she said, and was very happy, and the <i>alan</i> truly looked at it and it was the <i>balangat</i> of L&#299;g&#299;, and they all laughed. &#8220;What are you laughing for?&#8221; said Gamayaw&aacute;n to them? &#8220;We laugh because we are happy, because
it is beautiful,&#8221; said the <i>alan</i>. Not long after Gamayaw&aacute;n had a baby. Not long after she gave birth. &#8220;What are we going to do? I am about to give birth to
a child,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The best thing for us to do is for us to get a thorn and stick your little finger.&#8221; So they truly stuck
her finger, and the little baby popped out like popped corn.<a id="d0e5489src" href="#d0e5489" class="noteref">190</a> &#8220;What are we going to name it?&#8221; they said. &#8220;The best name is Galinginayen, for it is the name of the ancestor of the people
who live in Kadalayapan,&#8221; said the <i>alan</i>. Gamayaw&aacute;n gave him a bath and he grew about one span, for she used her magic. Not long after the baby was large, for she
always used her magic when she bathed him.<a id="d0e5498src" href="#d0e5498" class="noteref">191</a> Not long after the baby could fly.

</p>
<p id="d0e5504">&#8220;What can I do for this baby? I cannot work so well,&#8221; said Gamayaw&aacute;n. &#8220;The best thing for you to do, so you can do much work,
is for you to carry him to Kadalayapan and give him to his father,&#8221; said the <i>alan</i>. &#8220;That is good, I think; we will go and take him to Kadalayapan tomorrow.&#8221; When it became early morning she truly prepared
cakes to use as food for the boy on the way. When it became day they started. As soon as they arrived at the spring of Kadalayapan
she used her power so that all the people in the town and all who were dipping water at the well went to sleep; so all the
people who were pounding rice and working slept truly. Not long after they went up to the town. When they were approaching
the <i>balaua</i> of L&#299;g&#299; they saw him there <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5512"></a>Page 145</span>asleep. As soon as they reached the <i>balaua</i> they put the boy beside the man who was sleeping. &#8220;Stay here and wait, do not fall down,&#8221; they said to him. &#8220;Yes, mother,&#8221;
said the boy. They advised him not to tell who was his mother or where he came from, and they went home. As soon as they reached
the edge of the town, she used her power again and all the people who were asleep woke up.

</p>
<p id="d0e5517">L&#299;g&#299; was surprised when he saw the boy beside him when he woke up. &#8220;Why here is a boy by me, with my <i>balangat</i> which I lost when I went to take a bath,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;, and he asked where the boy came from and the name of his mother and
how he came. &#8220;Who are you talking to,&#8221; said his mother Langa-an. &#8220;&#8216;Who are you talking to,&#8217; you say mother, here is a boy
with my <i>balangat</i>,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;. Langa-an was in a hurry and she went down from the house and she went down two rounds of the ladder at one step.
As soon as she got down she took the boy to their house, where she was cooking and they asked him many questions. &#8220;My mother
is an <i>alan</i>&#8221; said Galinginayen. &#8220;What is your name then?&#8221; &#8220;My name is Galinginayen who is the son of an <i>alan</i> of Kabinbinlan,&#8221;<a id="d0e5531src" href="#d0e5531" class="noteref">192</a> said the boy. &#8220;No you are not the son of an <i>alan</i>,&#8221; they said. When Langa-an finished cooking they tried to feed him, but he would not eat. &#8220;If you eat my cake I will eat
with you,&#8221; said the boy. So they ate truly of the boy's provisions and he ate also with them.

</p>
<p id="d0e5537">When it became afternoon Gamayaw&aacute;n went to get the boy. As soon as she arrived at the edge of the town of Kadalayapan she
used her power again and all the people who were working and dipping water slept. She went to the town and L&#299;g&#299; slept again,
and she took the boy. As soon as she reached the edge of the town she used her power again and all the people who slept woke
up. As soon as L&#299;g&#299; woke up he saw that the boy was not by him. &#8220;What has happened to the boy? Perhaps his mother came to
steal him while I was sleeping,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;. Langa-an was surprised and sorry because the boy was gone.

</p>
<p id="d0e5539">As soon as the boy and his mother arrived in their house, he asked his mother how many blankets she had woven while he was
in Kadalayapan. &#8220;Ala, tomorrow you send me again to Kadalayapan.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Gamayaw&aacute;n. When it became early morning she
made cakes for his provisions. When it became day they took the boy to Kadalayapan. When they approached the town Gamayaw&aacute;n
used her power again so that all the people, even though they were working, slept again, and so they slept truly; then they
went to the town and they left the boy beside L&#299;g&#299; who was sleeping in the <i>balaua</i>. As soon as they were <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5544"></a>Page 146</span>far away from the town Gamayaw&aacute;n used her magic, and all the people who slept awoke. As soon as L&#299;g&#299; woke up he saw the boy
by him again, and they at once hid him.

</p>
<p id="d0e5546">When it became afternoon Gamayaw&aacute;n and her companions went to Kadalayapan to get the boy and as soon as they arrived she used
magic again so that all the people slept, then they went up to the town. They looked for the boy, but they could not find
him, and they were troubled. They went back home crying. As soon as L&#299;g&#299; woke up he went outdoors.

</p>
<p id="d0e5548">Five days later L&#299;g&#299; told his mother he thought they should build <i>balaua</i>. &#8220;We are going to make <i>Sayang</i>, mother, for we want to find the mother of this boy.&#8221; Langa-an said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Not long after they made <i>balaua</i> and when it became afternoon they made <i>L&#299;bon</i><a id="d0e5561src" href="#d0e5561" class="noteref">193</a> and they commanded someone to go and get the betel-nuts which were covered with gold, so that they might send them to invite
all the people in the world. As soon as the people whom they sent arrived they oiled the betel-nuts, and sent them to all
parts of the world to invite all the people.

</p>
<p id="d0e5567">Not long after the betel-nut which went to the town of Gamayaw&aacute;n arrived, &#8220;Good afternoon, lady. I cannot tarry, I came to
invite you, for L&#299;g&#299; and his mother and father of Kadalayapan make <i>Sayang</i>,&#8221; said the betel-nut. &#8220;I cannot come for there is no one to watch the house,&#8221; said Gamayaw&aacute;n. &#8220;If you do not wish to come
I will grow on your knee,&#8221; said the betel-nut. &#8220;Grow on my big pig, for I cannot go,&#8221; she said, so it went on to her big pig
and the pig squealed very much. &#8220;You get off and come on my knee,&#8221; said Gamayaw&aacute;n to the betel-nut, for she was sorry for
her pig. So the betel-nut went on her knee, and it grew high so that it hurt her. &#8220;Ala, you betel-nut, I am going now to take
a bath, and then I will come.&#8221; So the betel-nut got off and she went to take a bath. When she arrived at the river she was
in no hurry, for she did not wish to go, and the people from Pindayan, who were Iwaginan and his wife Gimbagonan, and the
other people passed by the place where she was bathing, when they were going to attend the <i>Sayang</i> in Kadalayapan. They saw the pretty lady taking her bath by the river. &#8220;Ala, you Gimbagonan, give me some betel-nut so that
I can give that lady a chew,&#8221; said Iwaginan. &#8220;No, do not lose any time, we are in a hurry,&#8221; said Gimbagonan. He compelled
her to give it to him, so he went to give the lady the betel-nut and Gimbagonan was angry. As soon as Iwaginan reached the
lady and offered her the betel-nut to chew she refused it, but he compelled her to chew it with him. As soon <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5575"></a>Page 147</span>as he gave the betel-nut to her he urged her to go with them to attend the <i>Sayang</i>. The lady did not want to go, but he urged her very long, until she went with them. She said, &#8220;Wait for me here while I go
to change my clothes, if you want me to accompany you, but it is shameful for me to go, for they did not invite me.&#8221; She went
slowly to their house and when Iwaginan and the others waited a long time for her Gimbagonan was angry with Iwaginan and said
bad words to him.

</p>
<p id="d0e5580">Not long after an Agta<a id="d0e5582src" href="#d0e5582" class="noteref">194</a> woman passed by them at the river. &#8220;Ay, Agta, did you not see the lady for whom we are waiting?&#8221; said Iwaginan. &#8220;No, I did
not see her,&#8221; said the Agta. &#8220;If you did not see her you come with us and we will go to attend <i>Sayang</i>&#8221; said Iwaginan to her. &#8220;I am ashamed to go, for I have no clothes,&#8221; said the Agta. &#8220;No, if I wish it, do not be ashamed,&#8221;
said Iwaginan. Not long after they went. As soon as they arrived in Kadalayapan the Agta went to sit down behind a rice winnower,
and Galinginayen was carried by his father and he took him past all the people and he noticed none of them, and when they
were in front of the Agta he wanted to go to her, but the Agta winked at him and he did not go to her though he recognized
her as his mother. Not long after the Agta became drunk, for they gave her much <i>basi</i> to drink. While she was drunk Iwaginan called L&#299;g&#299;. &#8220;Now, cousin L&#299;g&#299;, my companion the Agta is drunk and she has laid down
on the ground. I want you to take her into the house and give her a mat.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e5594">L&#299;g&#299; took her into the house and he held her by the little finger for he did not want to touch her. As soon as they were in
the house he put her by the door and he put some old clothes over her, and the boy said, when he saw his mother, &#8220;How bad
my father is, for he gave my mother the old blankets which the dogs lie on.&#8221; As soon as his father was among the people the
boy changed the blankets on his mother, and he sucked milk from her breasts. As soon as he had sucked the milk from her breasts
he went to play by the window, and the guests went below him, for they feared that he would fall. When they were there all
the time L&#299;g&#299; went to the house. Not long after he arrived in the house he saw the breasts of the Agta twinkle like stars,
and L&#299;g&#299; took the sharp knife and cut the skin off from the Agta. As soon as he had cut off all of the black skin, he threw
it out of the window. He lifted her up and put her on a good mat, and all the people who went to attend <i>balaua</i> went to where the skin had fallen, for they thought it was the child who had fallen, and they saw it was the skin of the
Agta. They were surprised.

</p>
<p id="d0e5599">Not long after Iwaginan was anxious to go home. &#8220;Ala, now, <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5601"></a>Page 148</span>cousin L&#299;g&#299;, I want to go home, for we have been here so long a time, do not detain us. Go and get my Agta companion so that
we can go home.&#8221; &#8220;I don't know where your Agta companion is now, for I did not see where she went.&#8221; Iwaginan was sorry and
he went to look for her. Not long after he saw her on the mat. &#8220;She is on the mat, my cousin Iwaginan, but I do not like to
let her go with you, for she is the cause of my making <i>Sayang</i>, for I wanted to find out who was the mother of the boy. Now she is his mother. The best thing for you to do is to marry
Apon&#299;bolinayen and I am going to marry this woman,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;.

</p>
<p id="d0e5606">Not long after Iwaginan went back home. As soon as they arrived in Pindayan he divorced Gimbagonan, and he went to marry Apon&#299;bolinayen.
So truly he married Gamayaw&aacute;n. As soon as the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> was over, he paid the marriage price. Next evening Iwaginan and Apon&#299;bolinayen lived together. Next morning they went to
wash their hair. &#8220;Wait for me here for I am going to dive in the river,&#8221; said Iwaginan. So he dived, and he went to the place
where the <i>alan</i> lived under the water and the <i>alan</i> said, &#8220;Eb we have something to eat for breakfast, it is a man.&#8221; &#8220;No, do not eat me, I came to change my clothes,&#8221; said Iwaginan.
&#8220;Is Apon&#299;bolinayen here?&#8221; they said. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said, and the <i>alan</i> covered each hair of his head with golden beads, and they gave clothes to him. After that when he went back home, they went
to guide him. As soon as they arrived by the river they saw Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;How cunning you are, Iwaginan! You told us she
was not here, and she is here,&#8221; said the <i>alan</i>. &#8220;If we had known that Apon&#299;bolinayen was by the river we would have eaten you, for we wanted to take her,&#8221; they said. &#8220;No,&#8221;
said Iwaginan, and they went home. A day later he took Apon&#299;bolinayen to Pindayan and Gimbagonan prepared the <i>baladon</i> poison, because she wanted to kill Iwaginan. As soon as he and Apon&#299;bolinayen arrived in Pindayan, Gimbagonan went to their
house, and she took betel-nuts. As soon as she reached the house she gave the nut to Apon&#299;bolinayen, and it had <i>baladon</i> poison on it. She gave also to Iwaginan, but it had no poison on it. As soon as they chewed the betel-nut Apon&#299;bolinayen
died. Not long after Iwaginan sharpened his headaxe and spear, for he intended to cut off Gimbagonan's head. They went to
get a medium<a id="d0e5629src" href="#d0e5629" class="noteref">195</a> to make the ceremony for Apon&#299;bolinayen, and when the medium was making the ceremony she said, &#8220;Apon&#299;bolinayen cannot be
cured unless Gimbagonan comes to cure her, for she used the poison which is <i>baladon</i>.&#8221; Not long after they went to get Gimbagonan and Iwaginan was anxious <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5638"></a>Page 149</span>to get her head, but she asked his pardon and she went to cure Apon&#299;bolinayen. As soon as she made Apon&#299;bolinayen drink of
her medicine, she was at once alive again. Not long after Gimbagonan went back to her house, and when she went back Iwaginan
said to her, &#8220;Do not do that.&#8221; &#8220;You are not good, Iwaginan. I do not know why you divorced me,&#8221; she said.

<p id="d0e5643">&#8220;Tikg&#299;, tikg&#299;, L&#299;g&#299;, if you want us to cut rice for you, we will come to work with you,&#8221; said the <i>tikg&#299;</i> birds, &#8220;Because we like to cut your rice <i>amas&#299;</i>, which is mixed with <i>alom&aacute;sk&#299;</i> in the place of Domay&aacute;s&#299;.&#8221; L&#299;g&#299; said to them, &#8220;What are you going to do? I do not think you can cut rice, for you are birds
and only know how to fly, you <i>tikg&#299;</i>.&#8221; But they still asked until he let them cut his rice. &#8220;Ala, L&#299;g&#299;, even if we are <i>tikg&#299;</i> we know how to cut rice.&#8221; &#8220;If you want to come and cut, you must come again, because the rice is not yet ripe. When you think
it is ripe, you come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If that is what you say L&#299;g&#299; that we shall come when the rice is ripe, we will go home and
come again,&#8221; said the <i>tikg&#299;</i>. Not long after they went home.

</p>
<p id="d0e5663">As soon as the birds went L&#299;g&#299; fell sick; he wanted always to see them, and he had a headache, so he went home to Kadalayapan.
The <i>tikg&#299;</i> used magic so that L&#299;g&#299;'s rice was ripe in a few days.

</p>
<p id="d0e5668">Five days later, L&#299;g&#299; went back to his rice field and the <i>tikg&#299;</i> went also, and they arrived at the same time. &#8220;Tikg&#299;, tikg&#299;, L&#299;g&#299;, Ala, now we have come to cut your rice <i>amas&#299;</i> which is mixed with <i>alom&aacute;sk&#299;</i> in the place of Domay&aacute;s&#299;,&#8221; said the <i>tikg&#299;</i>. &#8220;Come, <i>tikg&#299;</i>, if you know how to cut rice,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;. Not long after the <i>tikg&#299;</i> went. &#8220;We use magic so that you cut the rice. You rice cutters, you cut alone the rice. And you tying bands, you tie alone
the rice which the rice cutters cut,&#8221; said the <i>tikg&#299;</i>. So the rice cutters and bands worked alone and L&#299;g&#299; went home when he had shown them where to cut rice. He advised the <i>tikg&#299;</i> to cut rice until afternoon, and they said, &#8220;Yes, L&#299;g&#299;, when it is afternoon you truly come back.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;.

</p>
<p id="d0e5694">When it became afternoon L&#299;g&#299; went. As soon as he arrived at the field the rice which they had cut was gathered&#8212;five hundred
bundles. &#8220;Now, L&#299;g&#299;, come and see the rice which we have cut, for we want to go back home,&#8221; said the <i>tikg&#299;</i>. L&#299;g&#299; was surprised. &#8220;What did you do, you <i>tikg&#299;</i>? You have nearly finished cutting my rice <i>alom&aacute;sk&#299;</i> in the place of Domay&aacute;s&#299;,&#8221; he said. &#8220;&#8216;What did you do&#8217;, you say, and we cut it with our rice cutters.&#8221; &#8220;Now you <i>tikg&#299;</i>, I am ashamed to separate the payment for each of you. You take all you want,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;, so the <i>tikg&#299;</i> took truly one head of rice for each one. &#8220;Now, L&#299;g&#299;, we have <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5711"></a>Page 150</span>taken all we can carry,&#8221; said the <i>tikg&#299;</i>. &#8220;All right if that is all you want, help yourself,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;, &#8220;and you come again.&#8221; After that the <i>tikg&#299;</i> flew and took with them one head of rice each.

</p>
<p id="d0e5719">After the <i>tikg&#299;</i> left L&#299;g&#299; had the headache again, so he did not put the rice in the carabao sled, but went home in a hurry. As soon as he
arrived in his house L&#299;g&#299; used his power so that it again became morning. As soon as it became day the <i>tikg&#299;</i> went and L&#299;g&#299; went also and they arrived at the same time. &#8220;Tikg&#299;, tikg&#299;, L&#299;g&#299;, can we cut your rice which is <i>amas&#299;</i> mixed with <i>alom&aacute;sk&#299;</i> in the place of Domay&aacute;s&#299;?&#8221; &#8220;Are you here now, <i>tikg&#299;</i>?&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;. &#8220;Go and cut the rice and see if you can cut it very soon, and after that I will make <i>Sayang</i>, and you must come <i>tikg&#299;</i>,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;. &#8220;Yes, we are going to cut and you do not need to stay here. You can go home if you wish,&#8221; said the <i>tikg&#299;</i>. So L&#299;g&#299; went home.

</p>
<p id="d0e5745">As soon as he arrived in his house he went to make a rice granary. When it became afternoon they had finished cutting the
rice and L&#299;g&#299; went to the fields to see them. As soon as he arrived there, &#8220;We have finished all the rice, L&#299;g&#299;,&#8221; they said.
&#8220;Come and give us the payment and then you can go home and see the rice granary where you put the rice, and all the rice bundles
will arrive there directly, for you cannot carry them home.&#8221; &#8220;I cannot take them home, for I always have a headache when you
go. Since you came I began to have headaches,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;. &#8220;Why do you blame us, L&#299;g&#299;?&#8221; &#8220;Because since you came I have had
headaches.&#8221; After that L&#299;g&#299; went home to see the rice granary.

</p>
<p id="d0e5747">As soon as L&#299;g&#299; left them they used magic so that all the rice went to the granary of L&#299;g&#299; in his town. As soon as L&#299;g&#299; arrived
at the drying enclosure he saw the rice which the <i>tikg&#299;</i> had sent and he was surprised. &#8220;I wonder how those <i>tikg&#299;</i> sent all the rice? I think they are not real <i>tikg&#299;</i>&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;. As soon as the <i>tikg&#299;</i> sent all the rice to the town they went home, and L&#299;g&#299; went to his house.

</p>
<p id="d0e5761">Not long after he built <i>balaua</i> and made <i>Sayang</i>, and he invited all the <i>tikg&#299;</i>. As soon as the people whom L&#299;g&#299; invited arrived the <i>tikg&#299;</i> came also and they flew over the people and they made them drink <i>basi</i>. Not long after they became drunk. &#8220;Now L&#299;g&#299; we must go home, because it is not good for us to stay for we cannot sit among
the people whom you have invited, for we are <i>tikg&#299;</i> and always fly.&#8221; Not long after they went home and L&#299;g&#299; followed them. He left the people in the party and he watched where
they went, and they went to the <i>bana-&aacute;s&#299;</i> tree and L&#299;g&#299; went to them and he saw them take off their feathers and put them in the rice granary and L&#299;g&#299; said to them,
&#8220;Is that what you become, a girl; sometimes you are <i>tikg&#299;</i> who come to cut <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5787"></a>Page 151</span>rice for me. Now that you are not <i>tikg&#299;</i> I would like to marry you.&#8221; &#8220;It is true that I am the <i>tikg&#299;</i> who came to cut rice, because you would not have found me if I had not done it.&#8221; He married the woman who had power so that
she became several birds,<a id="d0e5795src" href="#d0e5795" class="noteref">196</a> and he took her home.

</p>
<p id="d0e5801">When they arrived in Kadalayapan the people whom L&#299;g&#299; had invited were still there and were dancing. The father and mother
of L&#299;g&#299; were surprised and so they chewed betel-nut so as to find out who the lady was. The quid of Ebang and Pagatip&aacute;nan
and the quid of Apon&#299;bolinayen (the <i>tikg&#299;</i>) went together. The quid of Langa-an and Pagbok&aacute;san went to the quid of L&#299;g&#299; and thus they knew who Apon&#299;bolinayen was. Ebang
and Pagatip&aacute;nan were surprised that she was their daughter, and they called her Apon&#299;bolinayen, and they called L&#299;g&#299; Apon&#299;tolau.
As soon as they found out who she was, L&#299;g&#299; gave the payment to the relatives of Apon&#299;bolinayen. As soon as he made the payment,
they played the <i>gansas</i> and danced for three months. As soon as the <i>balaua</i> was over all the people went home and Apon&#299;bolinayen's father asked her where she had been. She said she had been in the
<i>bana-&aacute;s&#299;</i> tree where Kabon&#299;yan<a id="d0e5815src" href="#d0e5815" class="noteref">197</a> had put her, and they were surprised for they did not know when Kabon&#299;yan had taken her from them. After that they used magic
and the house where Apon&#299;bolinayen had lived went to Kadalayapan. This is all.

<p id="d0e5823">There was a man named Wadagan, and his wife was Dol&#299;m&aacute;man. They were sitting together in the middle of the day, and Dol&#299;m&aacute;man
commanded Wadagan to stick with a thorn the place between her fourth and little finger. So Wadagan stuck her finger with the
thorn and as soon as he did so a little baby popped out. &#8220;What name shall we give to this boy?&#8221; said Wadagan. &#8220;You ask what
name we shall give him, we are going to call him Kanag Kabagbagowan,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Give him a bath every day.&#8221; &#8220;I use my
power so that every time I give him a bath he will grow.&#8221;<a id="d0e5825src" href="#d0e5825" class="noteref">198</a> She always said this when she bathed him and every time the baby grew. Not long after she said, &#8220;I use my power so that when
I bathe him again he will be so big he will ask for his clout, belt, and top.&#8221; As soon as she said this and bathed him the
boy became big and asked for his clout, belt and top. Not long after he dressed up and took his top and went to play with
the other boys.

</p>
<p id="d0e5831">Not long after Dol&#299;m&aacute;man said to Wadagan, &#8220;Take care of the boy <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5833"></a>Page 152</span>while I go to the well,&#8221; and Wadagan said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; As soon as Dolim&aacute;man arrived at the well Wadagan made a little raft and
Kanag went to the place where he was working and asked, &#8220;What is that for father?&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;What is that for,&#8217; you say. I am going
to make it for your toy.&#8221; Not long after he said, &#8220;My son go and change your clothes and as soon as you change your clothes
I will see you.&#8221; When Kanag went to change his clothes his father was watching for him. He said, &#8220;My dear son, now we will
follow your mother to the well.&#8221; So they went, but they did not go to the place where Dolim&aacute;man was. They went to the east
of Dolim&aacute;man, and Wadagan said, &#8220;Ala, Kanag, go on the raft which I have just made, and I will drag it up stream with a rope.&#8221;
Kanag did not want to, but his father lifted him and put him on the new raft. As soon as he put him on the raft he pushed
it out into the current and then he went back home.

</p>
<p id="d0e5835">When he reached the yard Wadagan went into the <i>balaua</i> and laid down, and when Dolim&aacute;man returned she inquired for Kanag and she said, &#8220;Where is Kanag? Why can I not see him here?&#8221;
Wadagan said, &#8220;I do not know. I think he is playing with the other boys in the east.&#8221; Not long after Dolim&aacute;man went to ask
Agtanang and Gamayawan, and she said to them, &#8220;Did you see our son Kanag?&#8221; &#8220;No, we did not see him,&#8221; they replied. Not long
after, while she was inquiring, they told her the truth, and they said, &#8220;He went to the well with his father and they carried
a little raft which had just been made.&#8221; Not long after Dolim&aacute;man went to the west of the well and she saw the marks of the
raft in the sand by the river and she sat there for along time and Agtanang and Gamayawan shaded her while she sat there by
the river.

<p id="d0e5840">Not long after the old woman Alokot&aacute;n went to the well for she felt hot. As she was taking a bath she saw the little raft
which was just made and said, &#8220;You new little raft, if the son of Wadagan and Dolim&aacute;man is inside of you, come here.&#8221; So the
little raft went to her where she was making a pool in which the dead or sick were put to restore them. As soon as she finished
the pool she took him to her house and Kanag asked for something to eat. The old woman Alokot&aacute;n said, &#8220;Go and eat, it is already
prepared.&#8221; So Kanag went and ate and he said, &#8220;Mother, give me that nose flute so I can play.&#8221; So she gave it to him and he
played. &#8220;Agdal&#299;yan, you are feeling so happy while your mother is feeling unhappy, and is going to die by the river side,&#8221;
said the flute as he played. So he stopped playing and he said, &#8220;What is the matter with this flute? It sounds bad. I am going
to break you into pieces.&#8221; Not long after he asked the old woman Alokot&aacute;n for the <i>bunkaka</i><a id="d0e5844src" href="#d0e5844" class="noteref">199</a> <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5847"></a>Page 153</span>and she gave it to him. When he received it he played, and the <i>bunkaka</i> said the same as the flute. &#8220;What is the matter with this <i>bunkaka</i> that it talks bad? I am going to break you.&#8221; He put it down again and said to Alokot&aacute;n, &#8220;Mother, I am going to play with
the other boys.&#8221; &#8220;No, do not go,&#8221; said the old woman, but he went nevertheless to play with the boys.

</p>
<p id="d0e5855">Not long after he reached the <i>balaua</i>, and he met a little boy playing with <i>l&#299;p&#299;</i> nuts, and they played together. &#8220;Will you come with me to the place where my mother is while I ask for my tobacco?&#8221; said
Dagol&aacute;yan. &#8220;If that is what you say we will go,&#8221; said Kanag. So they went to the place where Dolim&aacute;man was and the milk from
her breasts went to Kanag's mouth. &#8220;Here is my son now,&#8221; said Dolim&aacute;man who was lying down and she sat up. &#8220;What is the matter
of this woman, she called me her son and she is not my mother,&#8221; said Kanag. &#8220;Where is your mother then?&#8221; said Dolim&aacute;man. &#8220;My
mother is in Nagbotobot&aacute;n and her name is Alokot&aacute;n,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;Ala, let us go. Where is Nagbotobot&aacute;n? Guide me,&#8221; said
Dolim&aacute;man. As soon as they arrived, she said, &#8220;Good morning, my Aunt.&#8221; &#8220;Good morning also,&#8221; said Alokot&aacute;n. &#8220;My son is with
you,&#8221; said Dolim&aacute;man. &#8220;Yes, your son is with me, because I met him by the river near the well.&#8221; &#8220;How much must I pay you,
my Aunt, because you found him and he has staid with you,&#8221; said Dolim&aacute;man to the old woman. &#8220;I do not wish anything, for my
reason for taking him was so that I might have someone to inherit my possessions, because I have no child.&#8221; &#8220;That is not my
mother,&#8221; said Kanag to Alokot&aacute;n, and she replied, &#8220;Yes, that is your mother, but your father put you on the river when you
were a little boy, and I found you there and I took you, so I might have someone to inherit my things.&#8221; Not long after, &#8220;Ala,
my Aunt, now we are not going home we will stay here, because my husband Wadagan does not like us.&#8221; So they used magic so
that their house in Kadalayapan went to Nagbotobot&aacute;n, and the people were surprised at the noise made by the house when it
went to Nagbotobot&aacute;n. They saw that it was a big house all made of gold, and they placed it near to the house of Alokot&aacute;n.
Not long after Wadagan made <i>balaua</i>, because he could not find his family in their golden house.

</p>
<p id="d0e5866">Wadagan got out of the <i>balaua</i> and said, &#8220;I am going to take a walk and see if I can meet Dolim&aacute;man and our house which is made of gold.&#8221; Not long after
he went to walk, and he did not meet any of them. &#8220;I am going to go to Nagbotobot&aacute;n and see if the new raft went there.&#8221; So
Wadagan went and not long after, while he was walking, he reached the edge of the town of Nagbotobot&aacute;n, and he saw the golden
house, and he went to it directly, and he said, &#8220;Perhaps that was our house, for <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5871"></a>Page 154</span>there was no other to compare with it.&#8221; When he arrived in the yard he said, &#8220;Good morning.&#8221; &#8220;Good morning also,&#8221; said the
old woman Alokot&aacute;n. &#8220;How are you, my Aunt?&#8221; She said, &#8220;We are well.&#8221; And he asked her if she had seen the little raft pass
by and she said, &#8220;Yes, it passed by here and I took it.&#8221; So they made him go upstairs and when he got up there he saw Dolim&aacute;man
and Kanag, and Kanag did not know his father. &#8220;You call me father, for you are my son,&#8221; said Wadagan to him. &#8220;No, you are
not my father,&#8221; said Kanag, &#8220;If you do not wish to call me so, then I will go home, and we will leave you here. Let us go
Dolim&aacute;man. If Kanag does not like me it is all right,&#8221; said Wadagan. &#8220;I don't like you, for you sent me away,&#8221; said Kanag.
&#8220;Go back home, we are going to stay here,&#8221; said Dolim&aacute;man. So Wadagan went back home and he went everywhere and Dolim&aacute;man,
Kanag and Dagol&aacute;yan staid in Nagbotobot&aacute;n.

<p id="d0e5878">There was a man Awig and Apon&#299;bolinayen, and there was a girl named Linongan. &#8220;Ala, you make Linongan start for she goes to
watch the mountain rice. You cook for her so that she goes to watch and I go to guide her,&#8221; said Awig. &#8220;Why do you dislike
our daughter Linongan? Do not make her go to watch for she is a girl. If she were a boy it would be all right. You know that
a girl is in danger. That is why you must not put her to watch the field.&#8221; &#8220;No you give her cooked rice and cooked meat and
make her start, for I am ready to go now,&#8221; said Awig.

</p>
<p id="d0e5880">Not long after they went to the place where the mountain rice grew, and he went to station her in the high watch house. He
commanded her to climb, and when she was in the middle of the ladder she was afraid, for she nearly fell down, it was so high.
Not long after she reached the watch house. When she looked down it seemed as if her eyes fell down it was so high. &#8220;Ala,
you my daughter Linongan live here and watch our rice, I will come to see you. Do not show yourself if anyone comes,&#8221; said
Awig to her and he went home to Natpangan. &#8220;Ala, you are so happy now, Awig, for you cannot see our daughter Linongan,&#8221; said
his wife Apon&#299;bolinayen, and Awig laid down in the <i>balaua</i> and Apon&#299;bolinayen laid down in the room.

</p>
<p id="d0e5885">As soon as Awig left Linongan in the field, the tattooed <i>alzados</i> went to the watch house, and Linongan laid down for she was afraid of them. When the tattooed <i>alzados</i> looked up toward the watch house it seemed as if the moon shone, &#8220;Ala, we will go up and see what that is.&#8221; They went up,
and when they arrived in the place where the girl was they were surprised at her beauty. &#8220;We will not kill her,&#8221; said the
young <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5893"></a>Page 155</span>men to the bravest of them. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the bravest, &#8220;get away so I can see her, if she is very beautiful.&#8221; When the young
men got away he cut her in two at her waist. They took her body and her head and went home. &#8220;Why did you kill her,&#8221; said the
young men. &#8220;So that you do not get a bad omen, young men,&#8221; said the bravest of them.

</p>
<p id="d0e5895">Not long after they had killed Linongan, &#8220;Why does my breast flutter so, Awig?&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;I feel sad also,&#8221; said
Awig. &#8220;Ala, Apon&#299;bolinayen you cook food for me to take when I go and see our daughter,&#8221; said Awig. Apon&#299;bolinayen truly went
to cook for him. When Apon&#299;bolinayen finished cooking, &#8220;Ala, give me my dark colored clout and my belt which has pretty colors,
so that I go at once to the place where the tattooed <i>alzados</i> are. Perhaps they found our daughter. Look often at the <i>lawed</i> which I shall plant by the stove. If it wilts so that its leaves are drooped, you can say Awig is dead.&#8221;<a id="d0e5903src" href="#d0e5903" class="noteref">200</a>

</p>
<p id="d0e5909">When Apon&#299;bolinayen thought he had arrived at the field she looked at the <i>lawed</i> and it was green and flourishing. Not long after Awig saw the blood below the watch house. &#8220;Perhaps this is the blood of
my daughter. I am going to see if they have killed her.&#8221; He climbed up, and when he got up, the body and head were not there,
so he went down. As soon as he got down he sat and he bent his head, &#8220;What can I do? Where am I going to go to find my daughter?&#8221;
he said. Not long after he took a walk. When he reached the jungle he looked at the big high tree. [&#8220;We can see all over the
world from the high trees.&#8221; This was a side remark by the story-teller.] &#8220;The best thing is for me to climb so that I watch and see where the <i>alzados</i> live, where my daughter is,&#8221; he said, and so he climbed. As soon as he climbed up he saw all over the world. He looked to
the west, there were no people there who celebrated. &#8220;There is no one there,&#8221; he said. He looked toward the north. There were
none there who celebrated. &#8220;There is no one there,&#8221; he said. He turned his face to the east, there was no one there. When
he looked in the south he saw the <i>alzados</i> who were making a celebration; and they danced with the head of his daughter. &#8220;Perhaps that is my daughter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How
terrible if it is my daughter,&#8221; and his tears dropped. Not long after he went down. As soon as he got down, &#8220;If I follow the
path I will spend much time. The best way is for me to go through the woods, to make the way short. I will go where they are,&#8221;
he said, and he went.

</p>
<p id="d0e5923">When he had almost reached the place where the <i>alzados</i> were dancing he said, &#8220;What can I do to get the head of my daughter?&#8221; and he bent his head. Not long after he remembered
to go and get the juice <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5928"></a>Page 156</span>of the poison tree. As soon as he secured it he split some bamboo for his torch, as he went to the celebration of the <i>alzados</i>. As soon as he arrived there he said, &#8220;Good evening.&#8221; &#8220;Good evening,&#8221; they answered. He laid down the torch by the fire of
the <i>alzados</i>, who thought him a companion. &#8220;Where did you come from? It has taken you so long to arrive we thought that you were dead.
We did not meet you, but we found one lady who never goes out of the house, who is very beautiful, that is why we celebrate.&#8221;
&#8220;I took long because I was in the middle of the wood, for I wanted to get a head. I was ashamed to go back home without a
head, but I did not meet anyone, so I did not secure one, for I had a bad sign. That is why I did not reach the town where
I wanted to go and fight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ala, make him sit down,&#8221; said the bravest. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said <i>alzados</i> and they made him sit, and they danced again. &#8220;Ala, you give him a coconut shell filled with <i>basi</i>, then he must dance, when he finishes to drink,&#8221; said the bravest again. Awig stood up. &#8220;Ala, I ask that if it is possible
I take the coconut shell, for I am the one who must give the people to drink, and when I have made all drink, then I will
dance. I will make <i>kanyau</i><a id="d0e5944src" href="#d0e5944" class="noteref">201</a> so that next time I may be successful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ala, you give the golden cup to him, and let him serve us drink. As soon
as he will make us drink we will make him dance.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; they said. Not long after he took the cup and he used his power so
that though he drank the <i>basi</i> the poison which he put in the big jar would not kill him, and he drank first. As soon as he drank he made the bravest drink.
Not long after he made all of them drink, and the <i>alzados</i> all died, for he used magic so that when they had all drunk then they all died. He put a basket on his back, and he went
to put the head of his daughter in the basket. He took the head into the middle of the circle, and he took all the valuable
things which the <i>alzados</i> had put on her. As soon as he got all the things he went home.

</p>
<p id="d0e5962">When he was in the middle of the field he turned back his face and saw four young <i>alzados</i> who followed him through the cogon grass, and he used magic so that the flame of the fire was so hot that the <i>alzados</i> who followed could not reach him.<a id="d0e5970src" href="#d0e5970" class="noteref">202</a> When the flame of the fire was over he turned his face again when he reached the middle of the next field. He used his magic
again so that the flame was so high there that the <i>alzados</i>, who always followed, could not reach him. As soon as the flame was gone they followed again, and Awig shouted. The <i>alzados</i> were frightened and were afraid to follow him for they were then near to <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e5982"></a>Page 157</span>Kaodanan. &#8220;Ala, we will go back or the people of Kaodanan will inherit our heads,&#8221; and they went back home. Those were all
who were left for Awig did not give them poison.

</p>
<p id="d0e5984">Not long after Awig arrived in Natpangan. He went back to get the rest of his daughter's body from the place where the mountain
rice grew. When he arrived in their house he joined the body and the head. They looked at her and she was sweating. &#8220;Ala,
Awig you go and command someone to get the old woman Alokot&aacute;n. When she speaks to the cut on our daughter's body the body
and head will join better,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen to Awig. Not long after, &#8220;Ala, you spirit helpers go to get old woman Alokot&aacute;n
of Nagbotobot&aacute;n, so she will speak to the cut on Linongan,&#8221; said Awig. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the spirits and they went. Not long after
they arrived at Nagbotobot&aacute;n, &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; they said, &#8220;What are you coming for you spirits,&#8221; said old woman Alokot&aacute;n. &#8220;&#8216;What
are you coming for you say?&#8217; Awig sent us to call you and take you to Natpangan, for you to speak to the cut on their daughter,
for the <i>alzados</i> killed her when they sent her to watch the mountain rice.&#8221; &#8220;That is why those people are bad, for when they have only one
daughter they do not know how to take care of her.&#8221; &#8220;Ala, what can you do, that is their custom. Please come,&#8221; said the spirits.
&#8220;Ala, you go first, and I follow. I ought not come for I want them to feel sorrowful for their only daughter, which they sent
to the field, but I will come for I want Linongan to live. You go and I will follow,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; they said.

</p>
<p id="d0e5989">When the spirits arrived in Kaodanan the old woman Alokot&aacute;n arrived also. As soon as she arrived she went at once where Linongan
was lying. &#8220;Ala, you Apon&#299;bolinayen and Awig this is your pay, for although you have only one daughter you sent her to the
mountain field,&#8221; said the old woman Alokot&aacute;n to them. Awig and Apon&#299;bolinayen did not answer for they were ashamed. When the
old woman had finished to talk to them she put saliva around the cut on Linongan and caused it to join. When she finished
joining it, &#8220;I use my power so that when I snap my perfume<a id="d0e5991src" href="#d0e5991" class="noteref">203</a> which is called <i>dagimonau</i> (&#8216;to wake up&#8217;) she will wake up at once.&#8221; When she snapped her perfume Linongan woke up at once. &#8220;I use my power so that when I use my
perfume <i>al&#299;kadakad</i> (sound of walking or moving) she will at once make a movement.&#8221; When she snapped her perfume Linongan moved at once. &#8220;I use
my power so when I snap my perfume <i>banaw&#7431;s</i> she will blow out her breath!&#8221; When she snapped her perfume, she at once breathed a long breath. &#8220;<span class="smallcaps">Wes</span> how terrible my sleep was,&#8221; said <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e6018"></a>Page 158</span>Linongan. &#8220;&#8216;How terrible my sleep&#8217; you say. The tattooed <i>alzados</i> nearly inherited you. I went to follow you because they took you to their town and they danced with your head,&#8221; said Awig.


</p>
<p id="d0e6023">Not long after Awig went to take four small branches of the tree and he used magic, &#8220;I use my power so that when the four
sticks will stand they will become a <i>balaua</i>.&#8221; He used his power and truly the four sticks became a <i>balaua</i> and Apon&#299;bolinayen commanded someone to pound rice. Ten days later they made <i>L&#299;bon</i>, on the tenth night. When it became morning Awig commanded someone to go and get the betel-nut which is covered with gold.
As soon as they arrived they oiled the betel-nuts. &#8220;Ala, all you betel-nuts, you go to invite the people from the other towns
who are relatives so that they will come to make <i>balaua</i> with us. You go to all the towns where our relatives live and invite them, and if they do not wish to come you grow on their
knees.&#8221; So the betel-nuts went.

</p>
<p id="d0e6037">Not long after the people whom they invited came to the place where they made <i>balaua</i> and they all danced. The companion of Ilw&#299;san of Dag&aacute;pan in dancing was Alama-an. When Ilw&#299;san stamped his feet the earth
rumbled. When he looked up at Alama-an he said, &#8220;How terrible is the love of the ladies toward me; she thinks that I love
her,&#8221; but he wished to dance with Linongan. When they finished dancing, Asigtanan and Dondony&aacute;n of Bagtalan danced next. When
Dondony&aacute;n shook his foot the world smiled and it rained softly. When they finished dancing, Iwaginan and Linongan, who never
goes outdoors, danced. When Iwaginan stamped his feet, all the coconuts in the trees fell, and when Linongan moved her toes
in dancing all the tattooed fish came to breathe at her feet for the water covered the town when they danced. When they were
still dancing the water flowed, only a little while, and it was only knee deep, &#8220;Ala, you Iwaginan and Linongan, stop dancing
because we are deluged,&#8221; said Awig and the old woman Alokot&aacute;n. They stopped dancing and the water went down again from the
town. &#8220;How terrible are the people who are like Kabon&#299;yan for they are so different from us,&#8221; said the other people who went
to attend <i>balaua</i> with them.

</p>
<p id="d0e6045">Not long after, when all the people had finished dancing and the <i>balaua</i> was over, the people went home and Iwaginan was engaged to Linongan. Apon&#299;bolinayen said, &#8220;We do not wish that our daughter
be married yet,&#8221; but Awig agreed. &#8220;Why do you agree, Awig, do you not like our only daughter?&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;I like
her, but it is better for her to be married. He seems to have power. Don't you know that a girl has many dangers? It is better
for her to be married, because she is the only daughter we have,&#8221; said Awig. Not long after <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e6050"></a>Page 159</span>they made <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>. &#8220;Ala, now, sister-in-law, how much will we pay?&#8221; said Dinow&aacute;gan to Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;The <i>balaua</i> three times full of jewels,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;Ala, yes, sister-in-law,&#8221; she replied. So she used her magic and the <i>balaua</i> was three times full of jewels, and Apon&#299;bolinayen raised her eyebrows and half of the things in the <i>balaua</i> disappeared, and Dinow&aacute;gan used her power again and filled the <i>balaua</i>. &#8220;Ala, stop that is enough to pay for our daughter,&#8221; said Apon&#299;bolinayen. &#8220;I pay now.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Now that we have
made the payment we will go home,&#8221; said Dinow&aacute;gan. &#8220;If you do not let us take Linongan to Pindayan, Iwaginan will live here and I will come to visit them,&#8221; said Dinow&aacute;gan to
Awig and Apon&#299;bolinayen. As soon as Dinow&aacute;gan and her companions went home. &#8220;Ala, my wife we go to Pindayan to see our mother
Dinow&aacute;gan,&#8221; said Iwaginan. &#8220;Yes, if that is what you say we will go,&#8221; said Linongan. Not long after they asked Awig and Apon&#299;bolinayen,
&#8220;You go, but do not stay long,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; they answered.

</p>
<p id="d0e6070">When they arrived in Pindayan, Iwaginan and Linongan went to bathe in the river, and Iwaginan saw the place where the <i>alzados</i> had cut Linongan in her side, and he went to make a magical well in which a person can bathe and lose all scars and wounds;
and it looked as if she had no cut and she was prettier, and they went home. When they arrived in the house Dinow&aacute;gan was
surprised, for she was more beautiful than before. &#8220;I made the magic pool and cured the cut in her side which I saw,&#8221; he said.
Not long after when they had been two days in Pindayan, they went to Natpangan.

</p><a id="d0e6075"></a><h2>26</h2>
<p id="d0e6078">Duman&aacute;gan sent his mother Langa-an to Kaodanan. When she arrived there she said, &#8220;Good morning Ebang,&#8221; and Ebang replied,
&#8220;Good morning, cousin Langa-an. Why are you coming here?&#8221; &#8220;I came to visit you.&#8221; So they made her go upstairs and they talked.
Not long after they all became drunk and the old woman asked if Apon&#299;balagen had a sister, and they told her that he had one.
Soon they agreed on the day for the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>.

</p>
<p id="d0e6083">When the day agreed on came, Apon&#299;balagen put Apon&#299;bolinayen inside of his belt<a id="d0e6085src" href="#d0e6085" class="noteref">204</a> so they went to Kadalayapan. As soon as they arrived at the gate of the town of Kadalayapan, Sinogyaman carried cake and
rice to the gate of the town, to take away a bad sign if one had been seen while on the way. They did not like her so she
went back to the town and they sent Kind&#299;-ingan, and they did not like her <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e6091"></a>Page 160</span>either. As soon as Kind&#299;-ingan returned they sent Apon&#299;gawan&#299;. When she arrived at the gate of the town they were very glad
and Duman&aacute;gan thought that Apon&#299;balagen had used his power so that the sweets, made of rice, were not in the basket until
Apon&#299;gawan&#299; went to meet them at the gate of the town.

</p>
<p id="d0e6093">Not long after they went up to the gate of the town and they agreed on the marriage price when Duman&aacute;gan should marry Apon&#299;bolinayen.
They said the price was the <i>balaua</i> filled nine times. Not long after when they had paid they all danced. Then the people went back home and Apon&#299;balagen and
his people went back home also.

<p id="d0e6098">Not long after Apon&#299;bolinayen was very anxious to eat <i>biw</i> fruit of Tagapolo. So Duman&aacute;gan went to get it for her. He arrived where the <i>biw</i> was and he got some, and in a short time he returned to Kadalayapan and he gave the fruit to his wife to eat. As soon as
she ate it she became well again. After seven months she gave birth and they called the boy Asbinan. As soon as the boy became
large he went to play with the girls.

</p>
<p id="d0e6106">As soon as Asig&#333;wan of Nagwatow&aacute;tan noticed the braveness of Asbinan she made <i>balaua</i>, and she commanded the people to pound rice. Not long after she commanded the betel-nuts to go and invite their relatives.
The betel-nuts went to all the towns in the world and invited all the people. The next day they oiled the <i>gansas</i> and the people played them and all the people who heard them danced for they liked the sound of them very much. So Asbinan
went to attend the <i>balaua</i>. All the people arrived at the place by the spring and a big storm came and wet all of them. Not long after the people who
lived in the same town as As&#299;gowan, which was the town of Nagwatow&aacute;tan, went to meet them at the spring, to give them dry
clothes. They changed their clothes and went up to the town. As soon as they all danced Asbinan saw Asig&#333;wan and he wanted
to marry her. So he gave her betel-nut to chew and they told their names, and when they had told their names their quids showed
that it was good for them to marry. The father and mother of Asig&#333;wan were Gag&#7431;lagatan and Dinow&aacute;gan, but she lived with the
<i>alan</i>. Her father and mother did not know her until she made <i>balaua</i> and Asbinan did not know her until the <i>balaua</i>, then he married her at once.

</p>
<p id="d0e6126">As soon as he married her all his concubines used their magic power so that while he was living with Asig&#333;wan she would cut
her finger. Not long after she truly cut her finger and died. They put her in the <i>tabalang</i><a id="d0e6130src" href="#d0e6130" class="noteref">205</a> which had a rooster on top of it. Then all the concubines of <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e6136"></a>Page 161</span>Asbinan were glad. Not long after they sent the <i>tabalang</i> along the stream and the rooster on top of it crowed, and the old woman Alokot&aacute;n went to see it. She stopped the <i>tabalang</i> and took out the body of the dead person. Not long after she made her alive again. As soon as she made her alive again she
put her in a well and she became a beautiful girl. Not long after she became a bird and she flew back to the place where Asbinan
lived. The bird flew above him, and he tried to catch it. When he could not catch her, she went to the top of a tree, and
Asbinan went into his house and he was sorrowful, because his wife was dead. Soon he fell asleep and the bird went near to
him and Asbinan awoke and caught it. The bird became a girl again, the same as before, and Asbinan saw that it was his wife,
so he was very happy and they made a big party. They invited all their relatives. Not long after all the people arrived and
they all danced. The old woman Alokot&aacute;n was there and Asig&#333;wan told Asbinan that she was the woman who gave her life again,
so they treated her very good and the old woman Alokot&aacute;n gave them all her property, and all the people who went to attend
the party were very glad.

<p id="d0e6149">&#8220;When I was a young fellow I went to all parts of the world, to every town where the tattooed Igorot live, who were all enemies.


</p>
<p id="d0e6151">&#8220;Mother Dinow&aacute;gan put the rice in the pot which looks like the rooster's egg,<a id="d0e6153src" href="#d0e6153" class="noteref">207</a> so that I eat rice, for I go to fight the tattooed Igorots,&#8221; said &#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang who was four months old. &#8220;Do not go my
son Agimlang your feet are too young and your hands look like needles they are so small. You just came from my womb.&#8221; &#8220;Oh,
mother, Dinow&aacute;gan, do not detain me for it will make me heavy for fighting,&#8221; said Agimlang. As soon as he finished eating,
&#8220;Mother Dinow&aacute;gan and father Dagilagatan let me start, and give me the little headaxe and spear and also a shield, for I am
going to walk on the mountain Da&#333;l&aacute;wan.&#8221; Not long after he started. As soon as he arrived on top of the mountain Da&#333;l&aacute;wan
he sat on a stone which looked like a bamboo bench under the Alangigan tree, and there were <i>alan</i><a id="d0e6161src" href="#d0e6161" class="noteref">208</a> there who were young girls. &#8220;Oh, why are you here &#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang who just came from your mother's womb?&#8221; said the <i>alan</i>. &#8220;&#8216;What, are you here?&#8217; you say young <i>alan</i>, whose toes on your feet are spread out. I <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e6173"></a>Page 162</span>am going to fight with the tattooed Igorot,&#8221; said &#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang to them, and they talked for nine months, in the place
where the stone bench was. The <i>alan</i> girls wanted to see him all the time. After that, &#8220;You young <i>alan</i> girls, I am going to leave you.&#8221; &#8220;Do not go,&#8221; said the <i>alan</i>, &#8220;because you are a little baby, you just came from the place where your mother gave birth to you.&#8221; &#8220;Do not detain me, young
girls, for it is bad for me if you detain me, for I will be too heavy for fighting,&#8221; said &#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang. &#8220;If I return
from war, I will invite you to attend my big party,&#8221; he said to them, and so he went.

</p>
<p id="d0e6187">Not long after he arrived at the town where the tattooed Igorot lived, and they were so many they looked like locusts. He
used his power, &#8220;You, my headaxe and my spear, go and fight with the tattooed Igorot, and kill all of them.&#8221; As soon as the
tattooed Igorot heard what he said, they said, &#8220;Why, do you brave baby come to fight with us for, you are very young? Now
you cannot return to your town, for we inherit you,&#8221; said the bravest of the <i>alzados</i>.<a id="d0e6192src" href="#d0e6192" class="noteref">209</a> &#8220;If you had said that you intended to kill me I would have killed all of you, even though I am a baby just from my mother's
womb,&#8221; said Agimlang. So the bravest of the <i>alzados</i> told his people that they should prepare to fight with the baby, and they began to throw their spears at him, but they could
not hit him. As soon as all the spears and headaxes were gone, the baby fought with them, and his spear and headaxes killed
all the people who lived in that town. As soon as he killed all of them he used magic so that the heads of the tattooed <i>alzados</i> went to Pindayan. Not long after truly all the heads went to Pindayan and he followed them.

</p>
<p id="d0e6207">When he arrived at the spring of Lisnayan in the town of &#298;b&#333;wan he rested and he sat on the high stone and began to play the
bamboo Jew's harp and &#298;g&#333;wan saw him. &#8220;Adolan come and see this young fellow and hear him play the Jew's harp.&#8221; The harp said,
&#8220;&#298;waginan Adolan, Inalangan come and see your brother, if he is your true brother.&#8221; So Adolan went truly to see him and he
found that it was a newborn baby who was just beginning to walk. &#8220;Where did you come from little baby?&#8221; said Adolan. &#8220;&#8216;Where
did you come from?&#8217; you say. I come from fighting the tattooed Igorot.&#8221; &#8220;How does it happen that you went to war, for you are only just from
your mother's womb?&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;How does it happen?&#8217; you say. I heard my father saying that when he was young he went to all parts
of the world in all the towns,&#8221; said &#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang to Adolan.

</p>
<p id="d0e6211">Not long after he gave him betel-nut and they chewed. As soon as they finished chewing they told their names, and Adolan told
his <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e6213"></a>Page 163</span>name first and &#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang was next to tell his. After that they laid down their quids and they saw that they were brothers.
&#8220;Now, my brother, Adolan we will go to Pindayan, for I am going to make a big party, for I just return from fighting,&#8221; said
&#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang. &#8220;Ala, you go first and I will go to see our brother,&#8221; said Adolan.

</p>
<p id="d0e6215">Not long after &#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang started to go and he lost his way, and he went through the mountain rice clearing of Kabangow&#7431;yan,
who was the <i>Lakay</i><a id="d0e6219src" href="#d0e6219" class="noteref">210</a> and he walked through many <i>lawed</i> vines which were wide spreading and when anyone cut off a leaf they smiled. As soon as he arrived at the little house of
the old man, &#8220;Oh, grandfather, tell me the way back home and I will not take your head,&#8221; said &#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang to the old
man. &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am going home to the town of Pindayan, for I am returning from fighting.&#8221; &#8220;Stop while
I cook, and you can eat first, and then you can go,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;No, I do not wish to eat. Tell me the way back home,&#8221;
said &#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang. So he showed him the way to Pindayan, but missed the way and they went through the middle of the reeds,
and the place where the <i>lawed</i> vines grew, and he met the pretty girl who was his sister, who had been hiding between two leaves. &#8220;Now, pretty girl, I have
found you among the <i>lawed</i> vines, and I am going to take you,&#8221; said &#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang. So he took her and he put her inside of his belt.

</p>
<p id="d0e6231">Not long after he arrived in Pindayan and he made a big party. Adolan and Iwaginan and &#298;g&#333;wan went to attend the party. Not
long after he took Inalingan out of his belt, she was a pretty girl who looked like the newly opened flower of the betel-nut
tree. &#8220;Where did you get her?&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;Where did you get her?&#8217; you say. I met her in the place where there are many <i>lawed</i> vines, and when you cut their leaves they smile,&#8221; said &#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang.

</p>
<p id="d0e6236">&#8220;Now, brother, we are going to chew betel-nut, and see if we are truly relations,&#8221; said Dal&#299;wagenan (&#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang), and
he called Adolan, &#298;g&#333;wan, and all his brothers and sisters, and his father and mother. He gave them betel-nut to chew, and
Dagilagatan and Dinow&aacute;gan told their names first and Iwaginan was the next, and then Adolan and then &#298;g&#333;wan, but he said that
he was the son of the <i>alan</i>, and next was Agimlang and then the pretty girl. She said, &#8220;My name is Inaling who is the little girl who never goes out
of the <i>lawed</i> vines, which when somebody cuts they smile.&#8221; After they finished chewing the betel-nut and telling their names, they laid down their quids, and the quids &#298;g&#333;wan and Ginalingan
(Inaling) went to the quids of Iwaginan <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e6247"></a>Page 164</span>and Adolan. &#8220;Oh, my son, &#298;g&#333;wan and my daughter Ginalingan, I thought that I did not have any more my daughter and son and
that the <i>alan</i> had taken. We did not feed you rice,&#8221; said the old woman Dinow&aacute;gan. &#8220;Ala, my son, Agimlang, do not feel sorry, because you
heard what your father Dagilagatan said to you, because you met your brothers and sister who are &#298;g&#333;wan and Ginalingan,&#8221; said
the old woman Dinow&aacute;gan. After that they danced for about nine months. After that &#298;g&#333;wan and Adolan and Iwaginan went home
and they did not let Ginalingan go back home.

</p>
<p id="d0e6252">As soon as &#298;g&#333;wan arrived in his town he built <i>balaua</i> and he invited all his relatives who lived in different towns and all the <i>alan</i> in the world. Not long after the people whom he invited arrived in the town of &#298;g&#333;wan, and all the <i>alan</i> went to his <i>Sayang</i>, and the <i>alan</i> were surprised that Dagilagatan and Dinow&aacute;gan knew that &#298;g&#333;wan and Ginalingan were their son and daughter, so they asked
them. They said that &#298;bag&#333; wa Agimlang met them when he came from war and he took them to his party so they knew that they
were their son and daughter for they chewed betel-nut. As soon as &#298;g&#333;wan's <i>Sayang</i> was over the <i>alan</i> gave all their valuable things to him, and also those who had taken Ginalingan. As soon as they had given them all their
things the <i>alan</i> flew away and Dinow&aacute;gan and her husband took their sons and daughters to Pindayan.

</p>
<p id="d0e6281">There was a man named Asbinan who was the son of Ayo, but the old woman Alokot&aacute;n took care of him. &#8220;Ala, my grandmother Alokot&aacute;n,
go and engage me to Daw&#299;n&#299;san who looks like the sunshine, for I want to marry her,&#8221; said the young boy Asbinan. The old woman
replied, &#8220;I do not think they will like you, for she is a young girl who never goes outdoors.&#8221;<a id="d0e6283src" href="#d0e6283" class="noteref">212</a> &#8220;Ala, grandmother, you go anyway, and if they do not like me I will see what I shall do,&#8221; said Asbinan who was a handsome
young man. Not long after the old woman went. As soon as she arrived at the stairs of the house of the mother and father of
Daw&#299;n&#299;san, they said, &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; and the mother of Daw&#299;n&#299;san said, &#8220;Good morning, what did you come here for, Ayo and
Alokot&aacute;n of Kadalayapan?&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;What did you come here for?&#8217; you say. Our son Asbinan wants to marry Daw&#299;n&#299;san,&#8221; said Ayo. She
called them up into the house and they talked. &#8220;We will ask our daughter and hear what she says.&#8221; When they asked Daw&#299;n&#299;san
if she wished to <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e6289"></a>Page 165</span>marry Asbinan, she said, &#8220;Oh, my mother, I am ashamed to marry yet, I do not know how to do anything; so I do not wish to
be married now. Do not dislike me, but be patient with me.&#8221; So her mother said, &#8220;Pretty Ayo, I think you heard what she said.
Be patient.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e6291">Not long after Ayo and Alokot&aacute;n went back to Kadalayapan. When they arrived there, Asbinan asked them the result of their
mission. &#8220;Did they wish me to marry their daughter Daw&#299;n&#299;san?&#8221; His mother replied, &#8220;They said that Daw&#299;n-isan does not wish
to be married yet; so we came back home.&#8221; When he knew that they did not wish him for a son-in-law, for they did not give
any reason, he thought and he said, &#8220;My mother, hand me my golden cup, for I am going away.&#8221; So his mother gave it to him.
As soon as he arrived in the yard of Daw&#299;n&#299;san, he said, &#8220;Good morning, Daw&#299;n&#299;san, will you look out of the window at me?&#8221;
Daw&#299;n&#299;san said to the <i>alan</i>, who had spreading toes and who bent double when they walked,<a id="d0e6296src" href="#d0e6296" class="noteref">213</a> &#8220;Look out of the window and see who it is.&#8221; The <i>alan</i> said to her, &#8220;He wants you to look at him.&#8221; Daw&#299;n&#299;san said, &#8220;I cannot go to the window to look at him, for the sunshine is
hot. I do not wish the sun to shine in my face.&#8221; When Asbinan could not get her to go to the window, he used magic and went
inside of the golden cup, and he pretended that he was ill in his stomach. He said, &#8220;Ana, mother, I am going to die, for my
stomach suffers greatly,&#8221; and he said to the <i>alan</i>, &#8220;Ala, you <i>alan</i>, tell her that she must look out of the window to see me.&#8221; The <i>alan</i> said to Daw&#299;n&#299;san, &#8220;Come and look at him; he wants you to see him. He says that his stomach is ill.&#8221; But Daw&#299;n&#299;san said to
the <i>alan</i>, &#8220;Tell him that I cannot go and look at him, I am ashamed. You look at him and then you rub his stomach.&#8221; The <i>alan</i> told Asbinan that Daw&#299;n&#299;san would not look at him, and he would not let the <i>alan</i> rub his stomach. He said, &#8220;If Daw&#299;n&#299;san does not want to look at me from the window, and if I die it is her fault, for I
came here because of her.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e6323">The <i>alan</i> who saw that Asbinan was a beautiful young boy, said, &#8220;If you will not go to look at him, we are going to leave you, for
we fear that he is going to die because of you.&#8221; Daw&#299;n&#299;san did not wish the <i>alan</i> to leave her, and she said, &#8220;Ala, bring him up on the porch and I will see him.&#8221; The <i>alan</i> took him up on the porch, and she went to look at him. When she saw that he was a handsome boy, she said, &#8220;I am ashamed,
for I did not think he was a rich and handsome boy.&#8221; When she saw that the boy appeared to be suffering greatly she went into
the house; she changed her dress and went out on the porch, and she looked like the sunshine. When she reached the porch,
she rubbed <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e6334"></a>Page 166</span>the boy's stomach, and directly Asbinan sat up. Daw&#299;n&#299;san said to him, &#8220;Come into the house and we will tell our names and
see if we are relatives.&#8221; So they went into the house and she told him to set down on a golden seat which looked like a fawn.
As soon as he sat down he said, &#8220;Pretty, young girl, when I see you I am blinded by your beauty. I came here because I wish
to marry you.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, Asbinan! I am ashamed, but I do not want to be married yet,&#8221; said Daw&#299;n&#299;san. &#8220;Daw&#299;n&#299;san, even if you tell
me to leave you, I will not do it until you promise to marry me. I will stay with you now,&#8221; he said. Daw&#299;n&#299;san replied, &#8220;Even
though you should stay here one month, I do not care,&#8221; Asbinan said. &#8220;Let us chew betel-nut and see if the quids turn to beads
with no hole, and lie side by side; or if they lie parallel, then it is not good for us to marry; so we shall see.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e6336">Not long after they chewed betel-nut, and when they laid down their quids they were agate beads, and they laid side by side;
so they saw it was good for them to marry. &#8220;Ala, now it is good for us to marry and we are related.&#8221; Daw&#299;n&#299;san replied, &#8220;Ala,
go and tell your mother that if they have everything we want and will pay what we want, you can marry me.&#8221; Asbinan said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
and he went to his grandmother Alokot&aacute;n. &#8220;Ala, my grandmother Alokot&aacute;n, what shall we do? Daw&#299;n&#299;san said that if we have everything
they want and will pay it for her, she will marry me.&#8221; The old woman said, &#8220;Ala, do not worry about that, I will see.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e6338">Not long after they started and took Asbinan, and when they arrived at the house of Daw&#299;n&#299;san they agreed on the marriage
price. Her mother said, &#8220;If you can fill our <i>balaua</i> nine times with gold shaped like deer, and jars which are <i>add&#7431;ban</i> and <i>ginlasan</i>, Asbinan can marry our daughter.&#8221; Alokot&aacute;n and the others replied, &#8220;Ala, if that is what you say it is all right, and we
can pay more.&#8221; So Alokot&aacute;n used magic and the <i>balaua</i> was filled nine times with the things they wished, and there were more golden deer than jars. The father and mother and relatives
of the girl said, &#8220;Asbinan and our daughter Daw&#299;n&#299;san can be married now.&#8221; When the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> was over, Alokot&aacute;n used magic and she said, &#8220;I use my power so that they will not know that they are transferred to Kadalayapan,&#8221;
and all the houses went to Kadalayapan. Not long after the people who went to attend the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> found that they were in Kadalayapan and they were surprised, and the people from the other towns went home when the <i>pak&aacute;lon</i> was finished.

<p id="d0e6364">&#8220;I am going to lie down on the stone which is like a seat below the <i>dumalotau</i> tree,&#8221; said Ayo, for she felt hot in the middle of the day. <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e6369"></a>Page 167</span>&#8220;What shall we call our son?&#8221; &#8220;We shall call him Asbinan, who looks like the spreading branch of the betel-nut tree which
looks pretty in the afternoon,&#8221; said L&#299;g&#299;, her husband.

</p>
<p id="d0e6371">&#8220;Ala! Agb&#7431;n, my loving son, go to eat,&#8221; said Ayo. &#8220;Mother&#8212;pretty Ayo&#8212;I do not wish to eat when we have no fish roe.&#8221; After
that L&#299;g&#299; went to his friends who use the big fish net in the ocean. &#8220;Ala, my friends, search fish roe, for my son Asbinan
wishes to eat.&#8221; They went to examine the bellies of nine baskets of fish, but there was no roe. He went to his friends who
fish in the river. &#8220;Ala, friends secure fish roe which my son wishes to eat.&#8221; Soon after, &#8220;How much do I pay?&#8221; &#8220;You do not
pay, for this is the first time you have come to buy,&#8221; said those friends who fish in the river. &#8220;Agb&#7431;n, my child, come and
eat.&#8221; &#8220;Mother, pretty Ayo, I do not wish to eat the fish roe when there is no <i>dolang</i>,<a id="d0e6376src" href="#d0e6376" class="noteref">214</a> and I do not like to drink out of the scraped cocoanut shell when there is no glass which comes from the place of the Chinese,
and I do not like to eat from the bamboo dish when there is no dish from Baygan (Vigan).&#8221; After that L&#299;g&#299; went and got the
cup and the dish from the Chinese store.

</p>
<p id="d0e6379">&#8220;Agb&#7431;n, my loving son, come and eat, for everything is here which you wish,&#8221; said pretty Ayo. When they had finished eating,
&#8220;Father L&#299;g&#299; give me your love charm<a id="d0e6381src" href="#d0e6381" class="noteref">215</a> which you used when you were young, for I wish to go to the place where the maidens spin at night.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e6384">&#8220;Good evening, young girls,&#8221; said Asbinan. &#8220;I do not like to light my tobacco unless the fire is taken from the light of your
pipes.&#8221; They were anxious to offer their pipes, but when Tiningb&#7431;ngan stubbed her toe she stopped and Sinobyaman, who was
the prettiest, was the one on whom he blew his smoke (a part of the love charm). She vomited and her eyes were filled with
tears, and after that they went home, all those who spun together.

They went to get Asbinan who was sleeping, and he stepped on their heels as they walked.

<p id="d0e6388">&#8220;Ala, aunt, I cannot cure her unless we are married.&#8221; Then they decided on the day for <i>pak&aacute;lon</i>, and the price was the lower part of the house filled nine times with jars, which are <i>malayo</i> and <i>tadogan</i>. Then she made the cakes for the parents-in-law, and they carried the pig, and they received the marriage price which was

<p id="d0e6403">&#8220;Ala! my wife Iw&aacute;nen who loves me every afternoon, make cakes of rice which shall be my provisions when I go to the southern
place San Fernando and Baknotan, which is a part of Pangasinan.<a id="d0e6405src" href="#d0e6405" class="noteref">216</a> I am going to investigate the report concerning the beautiful women, who are like the rift in the clouds&#8212;the escaping place

<p id="d0e6408">&#8220;Ala! my soldiers who are many, catch my horse which is a pinto, which paces, which walks fast, which goes, which gallops,
which has sore sides.&#8221; &#8220;It is here already, the horse which is a pinto, the saddle is already placed.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e6410">&#8220;Ala! now my wife Iw&aacute;nen, I am going to leave you here. Keep your honor as a person of wealth. Perhaps some one will entice
you and we two will be ashamed before the people of our town.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e6412">After that he went and started&#8212;Tolagan who went toward the south. He whipped the pinto, he ran, he walked.

</p>
<p id="d0e6414">When he was in the town of Kaodanan his body was thirsty. &#8220;I go to the place of betel-nuts, where I shall drink the water
which is white like coconut oil.&#8221; He arrived at the place of the betel-nuts. He met a maiden who was like the place of a large
fire. There was no other such maiden.

</p>
<p id="d0e6416">&#8220;Good morning, maiden who takes water in the shady place of the leaves which grow, which are stripped off in the middle of
the place of betel-nuts, which bear fruit which anyone gathers. I come to drink with you the water which looks like oil,&#8221;
said Tolagan. &#8220;If you are the old raider cut me only once so that I have less to heal,&#8221; (she said). &#8220;No, I am not the old
raider, for I live in Baliwanan and I go to the south to Pangasinan.&#8221; &#8220;Do not continue the journey, for you have a bad sign.
The birds skimmed past in front of you, also in the rear and the sides.<a id="d0e6418src" href="#d0e6418" class="noteref">217</a> Go back to Baliwanan.&#8221; &#8220;If that is what you say pretty one, I shall turn back because of this sign.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e6424">He arrived at Baliwanan, but his wife was not there, for she had run away with Kabon&#299;yan<a id="d0e6426src" href="#d0e6426" class="noteref">218</a> to the town of the sky.

</p>
<p id="d0e6429">There was not a place he did not search for her. He went to the head man. &#8220;Ala, <i>presidente</i> of our town, I come to ask for companions while I search for my wife, who vanished last night.&#8221; He gave (the searchers),
but when they did not find her, he went to another town. He went to the place of Ba&#299;ngan in the town of the north. &#8220;Good morning,
I came to ask companions to search for her who was absent last night.&#8221; &#8220;If that is still your trouble&#8221; said Ba&#299;ngan, &#8220;you
go and <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e6434"></a>Page 169</span>see my sister, who is Imbangonan, whom you shall take for wife, who cannot belt herself unless there are nine belts. She is

</p>
<p id="d0e6436">&#8220;Good morning, Imbangonan,&#8221; said Tolagan. &#8220;I came to see you, for your brother told me we are to marry if you like me.&#8221;

</p>
<p id="d0e6438">&#8220;If you like me, we will chew green betel-nut and see what is your fortune.&#8221; When they finished chewing, the two quids went
into a line. &#8220;Ala! we will marry if you agree to pay 100 <i>gumtang</i> and 50 <i>ginalman</i>&#8221;.<a id="d0e6446src" href="#d0e6446" class="noteref">219</a>

</p><a id="d0e6449"></a><h2>31</h2>
<p id="d0e6452">There were two girls who went to take a walk and a rich man met them, and he asked, &#8220;Where are you going, you two girls?&#8221;
&#8220;We are going to walk around the town.&#8221; The rich man said, &#8220;Come and walk with me.&#8221; When they reached their house he gave
them some work to do and he treated them just the same as his daughters. The rich man was a king, and he put the girls in
a room and the princesses Mary and Bintolada were in the other room. The king and the queen gave dresses to the girls but
they did not give them any bracelets and rings.

</p>
<p id="d0e6454">Not long after the two girls went to the house of the jeweler and they ordered him to make rings and bracelets for them like
those the princesses had. As soon as they went in the house of Indayo and Iwaginan in the town of Pindayan, they asked for
water to drink. After that Iwaginan and Indayo gave them water to drink, and they thought that the two girls, who were dressed
like men, were ladies, so they followed them when they left and they took <i>basi</i> for them to drink.

</p>
<p id="d0e6459">As soon as the princesses arrived in the jeweler's house they commanded him to make rings and bracelets for them. As soon
as the jeweler began to make the rings and bracelets for them Iwaginan and Indayo arrived with the <i>basi</i>. Soon it became night and they ate and drank in the night and they became drunk, and they all slept in one room. The people
saw the beads on their arms and the jeweler awakened them and put them in another room so they did not sleep in the same room
with the others and he said, &#8220;I thought you were princes, for you dress like princes, but when I saw your beads I woke up,
for I think those two men are planning bad for you. Go and sleep in the other room.&#8221; So they went into the other room to sleep.


</p>
<p id="d0e6464">Not long after it became daylight and they returned home, and Iwaginan and Indayo did not see them, and they were very sorry
for they thought the princes were truly girls. So they went back home, and as soon as they arrived there they said, &#8220;We are
going to make <i>balaua</i>, to find out if those princes were truly girls.&#8221; So they began <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e6469"></a>Page 170</span>to build <i>balaua</i>. They sent messengers to go and invite people in every town. Not long after the people whom they invited arrived, and they
saw that the princes were not there. So they commanded their spirit aids to go to all the world and find those princes. So
the spirits became hawks and they flew about the world. As soon as they came near to the palace of the king they alighted
on a tree and they watched the princesses in the windows and hawks said, &#8220;<i>Tingi</i>.&#8221; The princesses heard the word &#8220;<i>Tingi</i>,&#8221; and they were Gan&#299;nawan and Asigtanan. They saw the birds from the window, and the hawks flew by them and the princesses
stroked their feathers, because they were pretty.

</p>
<p id="d0e6480">Soon the hawks seized them in their talons and flew away with them and carried them to Pindayan. Not long after they reached
there and Iwaginan and Indayo were very glad, and they made a big party and they invited the king. The king had been searching
for them for a long time. Some of the spirit helpers who had gone to the palace said, &#8220;Good morning. We came here to invite
you, for Iwaginan and Indayo sent us. They are making a big party for those princesses for whom you are searching, for we
took them to Pindayan, and Iwaginan and Indayo married them.&#8221; When the king heard the news he was glad, and he went to the party. Indayo and Iwaginan made him dance when he arrived, and
Kanag and Dagol&aacute;yen went to that party. Not long after they put those girls, whom Iwaginan and Indayo had stolen, in their
belts and they did not know what had become of their wives and they were sorry. Kanag and Dagol&aacute;yen took them home. When they
arrived home they told their names and they chewed betel-nut and they found that it was good for them to be married, instead
of Iwaginan and Indayo. Kanag married Asigtanan and Dagol&aacute;yen married Gan&#299;nawan. The mother of Gan&#299;nawan was Apon&#299;bolinayen
and the mother of Asigtanan was Apon&#299;gawan&#299;.

</p>
<p id="d0e6485">As soon as they were married and they had learned who their mothers were they built <i>balaua</i>, and they sent some betel-nuts to invite all of their relatives in other towns. Iwaginan and Indayo went to attend the <i>balaua</i>, and they danced. They saw that those girls were their wives and they tried to take them back home, but Kanag and Dagol&aacute;yen
would not let them. They said it was not good for them to be married even though they wished to be married to them, because
the girls would become oil when they went close to them. So Indayo and Iwaginan were very sorry. Gan&#299;nawan was the sister
of Kanag and Asigtanan was the sister of Dagol&aacute;yen. They did not find out that they were related until Indayo and Iwaginan
took them, for their mothers had lost them in miscarriages, and the girls became women by themselves, and the king found them.

was running to catch him. <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e7152"></a>Page 181</span>He ran his horse at full speed, but the spirit was gaining when the <i>lasta</i><a id="d0e7156src" href="#d0e7156" class="noteref">48</a> on the saddle caught on a dead limb and was jerked away. &#8220;Very good that you leave that or I would take your life,&#8221; said
the spirit. Then the man ran his horse until he got to Solay. When he got there, he could not get off his horse, for his legs
were stuck very tight to each side of the horse, so a man had to pull each leg loose and lift him from the saddle. That is
why we know that the spirits of the dead men sometimes do harm and go places.

the woman took the headaxes and cut him in the doorway. The &#298;bwa went under the house. His father could not wait for him;
he sent his second son and his third son. The boys could not take the body, because they were afraid of the headaxes, for
the woman had one in each hand. The &#298;bwa went there. He said to his sons, &#8220;Why do you not take the dead man?&#8221; His sons said,
&#8220;We could not take him, because if we go up in the house the woman takes the two headaxes and tries to kill us.&#8221; &#298;bwa went
up into the house; he broke the door of the house. He said to the woman, &#8220;Now I am your husband.&#8221; The &#298;bwa took the two ears
of the dead man; he ate one and gave the other to the woman to chew, like betel-nut, to see the sign. The sign of the saliva
was good. He made the woman's two breasts into one in the center of her chest. He took her to his house.

over and under the earth. Sometimes the moon almost catches the sun, but it always gets tired and gives up before it succeeds.
The sun and moon are the lights of Kadaklan and so are the stones which are stars. The dog of Kadaklan is the lightning.

the stones, and the iron. Now that is why you can get fire out of the bamboo and stones.

<p id="d0e7527">A man planted rice in the high land. When it was grown, he saw that something was eating it, though he had a fence around
it. One night he went to watch his field. About midnight he heard many wings and saw some big animals with wings alight in
his rice. He ran and caught one, and cut off its wings. The animal was pregnant and soon had a young one. Since then there
have been horses on the earth, but people have never seen any more fly. You can see the place on the horse's legs where the
wings used to be.

on the way, it rained very hard; and when they reached the river, they could not get across, so they prayed to the Spirit
that he would give them wings to cross. They at once became birds; but when they reached the other side of the river, they
could not resume the forms of men. Some of the men's wives had just died, and they had bark bands on their heads, as is the
Tinguian custom. When these became birds, their heads were white; but those of the others were black, and so they are to this

went home. The next day the man sent his wife to go to cut the rice. When she got to the rice, she thought to herself that
she could not cut it in a month. Said she to herself, &#8220;I want to be a bird.&#8221; She lay down on the floor in a little house that
the man had made. She put her hat over her to be her blanket. Then she became a bird which we call <i>kakok</i> now. Her cloth became her feathers. In the morning the man went with some rice for his wife to eat. When he got there, he
could not see his wife. He walked and walked, but he did not find her, then he came to the little house. He saw his wife's

<p id="d0e7594">In the first time Ganoway was the man who possessed a dog which caught many deer; and Kabon&#299;yan allowed. The dog pursued the
deer which went in a cave in the rock. The dog went in also, and Ganoway followed into the hole in the rock. He walked, always
following the dog which was barking, and he felt the shrubs which he touched. The shrubs all had fruit which tinkled when
he touched them. Then he broke off those branches which tinkled as he touched them, and Kabon&#299;yan allowed. He came to the
end of the cave in the rock which was at the river Makatbay, and his dog was there, for he had already caught the deer, which
was a buck. It was light in the place where he was, at the river Makatbay, and he looked at the shrub which he had broken
off in the dark place in the cave. He saw that the shrub was <i>denglay</i> which bore fruit&#8212;the choice agate bead, which is good for the Tinguian dress. He was glad. He cut up the deer into pieces
and placed it on a bamboo pole which he carried. He thought always of the beads and wished to return to that shrub which he
touched. He returned and searched, but was not able to find it, and because he failed he returned to his home in An-nay. There
was not one who did not envy him those beads which he brought home, and they asked him to show them the way to the cave. He
showed them the hole in the rock where he and his dog had gone in. They took torches and walked, always walked, but at last
they were not able to go further, for the rest of the cave was closed. That place is now called Ganoway, for he was the one
who secured the beads which grew in the cave of Kabon&#299;yan, which cave the spirit always keeps clean.<a id="d0e7599src" href="#d0e7599" class="noteref">72</a>

<p id="d0e7606">Magsaw&#299;, my jar, when it was not yet broken talked softly, but now its lines are broken, and the low tones are insufficient
for us to understand. The jar was not made where the Chinese are, but belongs to the spirits or Kabon&#299;yan, because my father
and grandfather, from whom I inherited it, said that in the first times they (the Tinguian) hunted Magsaw&#299; on the mountains
and in the wooded hills. My ancestors thought that their dog had brought a deer to bay, which he was catching, and they hurried
to assist it. They saw the jar and tried to catch it but were unable; sometimes it disappeared, sometimes it appeared again,
and because they could not catch it they went again to the wooded hill on their way to their town. Then they heard a voice
speaking words which they understood, but they could see no man. The words it spoke were: &#8220;You secure a pig, a sow without
young, and take its blood, so that you may catch the jar which your dog pursued.&#8221; They obeyed and went to secure the blood.
The dog again brought to bay the jar which belonged to Kabon&#299;yan. They plainly saw the jar go through a hole in the rock which
is a cave, and there it was cornered so that they captured the pretty jar which is Magsaw&#299;, which I inherited.

and help him kill the snakes. They came at once with big bolos, shields, and the trunk of the banana tree, which they used
to fight with. When they arrived, they were taken to the gap, and the snakes attacked them. The men fought with the trunk
of the banana tree, and the wings of the snakes stuck to the trunk; so they killed them easily. When they had killed them,
they came back to the leader and showed him, and he asked what should be their pay. They did not ask any reward, but the leader
gave them gold in the form of deer and horses. Then they went home, and after that the people of Abra could pass through the

the Abra river. When they were in Bano&aacute;ng, they sailed on a raft in the Abra river to come up to Langiden. When they reached
that town, they stopped there to stay a short time, because Tag&aacute;pen went to the town to give thoughts to the people there
and to give a nice face to the girls. When Tag&aacute;pen was in the town, in Langiden, his son Soliben was weeping on the raft by
his mother. &#8220;Sleep, sleep, sleep, my dear son, because your father is not here yet; it-to-tes, it-to-tes, so sleep my son,
do not weep,&#8221; said his mother, whose name is G&#299;&aacute;ben. When Tag&aacute;pen came back from the town of Langiden, they began to sail
again until they came to Pidigan. When they reached the town of Pidigan, they stopped there because Tag&aacute;pen went to the town
to give a nice face to the ladies and girls. Then his son wept again, &#8220;Oh, dear son, sleep, sleep, sleep; oh, dear son, sleep,
sleep, sleep, for your father is not here yet. When he comes back, he will get bananas for you to eat. It-to-tes, it-to-tes,

good thoughts, so they will be very wise.&#8221; When they arrived in Sinalang town, they left their raft in the river and went

<h2>The Turtle and the Monkey</h2>
<p id="d0e7661">There was once a turtle and a monkey who went to make a clearing. The monkey did not work, but the turtle was the one which
cleared the land. When one day passed, &#8220;Let us go to plant,&#8221; said the turtle. They went, and banana was what they went to
plant. The turtle planted his in the clearing, but the monkey hung his in a tree when he went to climb. Five days passed.
&#8220;Let us go to see our planting,&#8221; said the turtle. When they arrived where they had planted, the monkey saw that his banana
was dry, but that which the turtle had planted bore ripe fruit. When the monkey reached the place where the turtle sat, &#8220;I
am waiting for you, monkey, for I cannot climb my banana tree.&#8221; &#8220;Give me fruit, and I will go to climb. My banana which I
hung in the tree did not bear fruit,&#8221; said the monkey. The turtle laughed and agreed, but when the monkey climbed in the tree
he only ate and did not throw down any fruit. &#8220;Give me, monkey,&#8221; said the turtle. &#8220;The thumb still eats,&#8221; replied the monkey.
Then he pushed a banana up his anus and after that threw it down. The turtle ate it and again asked for fruit. &#8220;The little
finger still eats,&#8221; said the monkey. Then he finished eating the fruit and he slept on the banana tree. The turtle went to
search for long sharp shells, and when he had secured them he planted them upright around the tree, and cried, &#8220;Bad in the
east. Bad in the west.&#8221; Then the monkey jumped, and the shells pierced his side so that he died.

</p>
<p id="d0e7663">The turtle dried his meat and sold it to the other monkeys, and when he had finished selling he went under the house and hid
beneath a coconut shell. When all the monkeys had eaten the turtle cried, &#8220;They eat their relative.&#8221; Then the monkeys heard,
but could not see. The turtle called many times until at last they found him beneath the coconut shell. They agreed to kill
him with the axe, but the turtle laughed and pointed to the marks on his back.<a id="d0e7665src" href="#d0e7665" class="noteref">1</a> The monkeys believed him when he said he had often been cut by his father and grandfather; so they did not cut, but went
to get fire. &#8220;You cannot kill me with <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e7681"></a>Page 196</span>that. Do you not see that my back is almost black from burning.&#8221; &#8220;Ay-ay,&#8221; said the monkeys, &#8220;let us tie a stone to his waist
and drown him in the lake.&#8221; The turtle cried and begged them to spare him, but the monkeys did not know that the water was
the cause of his living, for it was his home. They threw him in the lake and when they had watched a long time, they saw him
float on the water and he was holding a large fish. Then all the monkeys tied stones to their waists and dived in the lake
to catch fish. They did not float in the lake, but they died. Only a pregnant monkey was left, but the turtle came and drowned
her also.<a id="d0e7683src" href="#d0e7683" class="noteref">2</a>

<p id="d0e7695">A turtle and a big lizard went to the field of Gotgotapa to steal ginger. When they got there the turtle told the lizard he
must be very still; but when the lizard tasted the ginger, he exclaimed, &#8220;The ginger of Gotgotapa is very good.&#8221; &#8220;Be still,&#8221;
said the turtle; but again the lizard shouted louder than before. Then the man heard and came out of his house to catch the
robbers. The turtle could not run fast, so he lay very still, and the man did not see him; but the lizard ran and the man
chased him. When they were very far, the turtle went into the house. Now, the man had a coconut shell which he used to sit
on, and the turtle hid under it.

</p>
<p id="d0e7697">The man could not catch the lizard, so in a while he came back to his house and sat on the shell. Bye and bye, the turtle
called &#8220;Kook.&#8221; Then the man jumped up and looked all around to find where the noise came from, but he could not find. The
turtle called &#8220;Kook&#8221; again and the man tried very hard to find what made the noise. The turtle called a third time more loudly
and then the man thought it was his testicles which made the noise, so he took a stone and hit them; then he died and the
turtle ran away.

</p>
<p id="d0e7699">When the turtle got a long way, he met the lizard again and they saw some honey on the branch of a tree. &#8220;I run first to get,&#8221;
said the turtle; but the big lizard ran fast and seized the honey; then the bees stung him and he ran back to the turtle.
On their road they saw a bird snare. The turtle said, &#8220;That is the <i>paliget</i><a id="d0e7703src" href="#d0e7703" class="noteref">3</a> of my grandfather.&#8221; Then the lizard ran very fast to get it, but it caught his neck and held him until the man who owned
it came and killed him. Then the turtle went away.

<p id="d0e7710">The <i>polo</i><a id="d0e7714src" href="#d0e7714" class="noteref">4</a> said to a boy named Ilonen, &#8220;Tik-tik-loden, come and catch me,&#8221; many times. Then the boy answered, &#8220;I am making a snare for
you.&#8221; The bird called again, &#8220;Tik-tik-loden.&#8221; &#8220;I am almost finished,&#8221; said Ilonen. Then the bird called again and the boy
came and put the snare over the bird and caught it. He took it home and put it in a jar and then went with the other boys
to swim. While he was gone, his grandmother ate the bird. Ilonen came back and went to the jar to see the bird, but no bird.
&#8220;Where is my bird?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I do not know,&#8221; said his grandmother. &#8220;Let me see your anus,&#8221; said the boy. Then he saw his
grandmother's anus and he saw feathers there and was very angry. &#8220;It is better I get lost,&#8221; he said and went away. He came
to a big stone called <i>balintogan</i> and said, &#8220;Stone, open your mouth and eat me.&#8221; Then the stone opened his mouth and swallowed the boy. His grandmother went
to find him and looked very much. When she came to the stone, it said, &#8220;Here is.&#8221; She called the horses to come to the stone.
They kicked it, but could not break. She called the carabao and they hooked it, but only broke their horns; then she called
the chickens and they pecked it, but could not open. Then she called thunder, but it could not help. Then her friends came
to open the stone, but could not, so she went home without the boy.

<p id="d0e7723">A frog was fastened to a fish hook in the water. A fish came and said, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; &#8220;I am swinging,&#8221; said the frog,
&#8220;come and try if you wish.&#8221; But the fish was angry with the frog. &#8220;You can not catch me,&#8221; said the frog. Then the fish jumped
up to catch him, but the frog pushed his anus upon the stick and left the hook so the fish was caught.

<p id="d0e7728">The five fingers were brothers. The other four sent the little thumb to get <i>posel</i>.<a id="d0e7733src" href="#d0e7733" class="noteref">5</a> He went to get, but when he got there, the <i>posel</i> said, &#8220;Kiss me, for I have a good odor to you.&#8221; So the thumb kissed him, and his nose stuck to the bamboo. The others could
not wait so long, so they sent the first finger to get. When he got there, he saw the thumb, and said, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;
&#8220;I am smelling this <i>posel</i>, for it has a good smell.&#8221; Then the first finger smelled and his nose was caught. The others could not wait, so they sent
the second <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e7742"></a>Page 198</span>finger and it happened the same. Also the third, and he also became fast. Then little finger went and when he saw the others,
he said, &#8220;You are very crazy,&#8221; and he cut them loose.

So they started to run. When the carabao reached a long distance, he called, &#8220;Shell,&#8221; and
another shell lying by the river answered, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He ran again and again, and every time he stopped to call, another shell
answered. At least the carabao ran until he died.

you get,&#8221; said <i>kool</i> to the crab. The crab pulled the ropes so tightly that he broke his big legs and died. When the shell went to see where the
crab was, he found him dead, and he begun to cry until he belched; then his meat came out of his shell and he was dead also.

but returned and said that the people in the house all desired the union. Then the boy's people got ready the things for <i>pak&aacute;lon</i><a id="d0e7795src" href="#d0e7795" class="noteref">10</a> and went to the girl's house. The girl's parents were very much surprised.

the first woman. Then they ate; but the other woman threw a rind with her teeth marks in the river, and the crocodile saw
it and knew who the woman was. He was very angry and went to her house and called the people to send out the woman so he could
eat her, for she had eaten his <i>atimon</i>. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; they said, &#8220;but sit down and wait a while.&#8221; Then they put the iron soil turner in the fire until it was red hot.

<p id="d0e7849">There was a man named Dogidog who was very lazy and very poor. His house was small and had no floor, only the boards to put
the floor on. He went to the forest to cut bamboo with which to make a floor, and he carried cooked rice with him. When he
got there he hung the rice in a tree and went to cut the bamboo. While he was gone, a cat came and ate the rice, so when the
man got hungry and came to eat, he had no rice, so he went home. The next day he went to cut again, and when he had hung the
rice in the tree, the cat came to eat it. The third day he went again and hung the rice in the tree, but fixed it in a trap;
then he hid in some brush and did not cut bamboo. The cat came to eat the rice and was caught. Then the man said, &#8220;I will
kill you.&#8221; <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e7851"></a>Page 200</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the cat, &#8220;do not kill me.&#8221; &#8220;Alright, then I take you home to watch my house,&#8221; said the man. Then he took the cat
home, and tied it near the door of his house and went away. When he came back, the cat had become a cock.

<p id="d0e7853">&#8220;Now I go to the cock fight at Magsingal,&#8221;<a id="d0e7855src" href="#d0e7855" class="noteref">14</a> said Dogidog, and he put his rooster under his arm and started for the place. He was crossing a river when he met a crocodile.
&#8220;Where are you going, Dogidog?&#8221; said the crocodile. &#8220;To the cock fight at Magsingal,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;Wait, I go with you,&#8221;
said the crocodile. Then they went. Soon they met a deer. &#8220;Where are you going, Dogidog?&#8221; said the deer. &#8220;To the cock fight
at Magsingal,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;Wait, I go with you,&#8221; said the deer. Then they went again. In the way they met Bunton.<a id="d0e7858src" href="#d0e7858" class="noteref">15</a> &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; said it. &#8220;To Magsingal to the cock fight,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;Wait, I go with you,&#8221; said the mound. Then
they went again and soon they met a monkey. &#8220;Where are you going, Dogidog?&#8221; said the monkey. &#8220;To the cock fight at Magsingal,&#8221;
said the man. &#8220;Wait, I go with you,&#8221; said the monkey. Then they went until they reached the place where was the fight in Magsingal.


</p>
<p id="d0e7861">The crocodile said to Dogidog, &#8220;If any man wants to sink in the water, I can beat him.&#8221; The deer said, &#8220;If any man wants to
run, I am very fast.&#8221; Then the earth said, &#8220;If any man wants to wrestle, I know very well how to do.&#8221; The monkey said, &#8220;If
any man wants to climb, I can go higher.&#8221; Then they took the rooster to the place of the fighting, and Dogidog had him fight
the other rooster. But the rooster had been a cat before, and he seized the other rooster in his claws, as a cat does, and
killed it. Then the people brought many roosters and bet much money and the rooster of Dogidog, which was a cat before, killed
them all, so there were no more roosters in Magsingal, and Dogidog won much money.

</p>
<p id="d0e7863">The people wanted some other sport, so they brought a man who could stay very long under water, and Dogidog had him try with
the crocodile. After more than two hours, the man had to come up first. Then the people brought a man who runs very fast,
and the deer raced with him, and the man could not beat the deer for he was very fast. Then they brought a very big man, but
he could not throw the earth. Last, the people brought a man who climbs very well and the monkey climbed with him, and went
much higher than the man.

</p>
<p id="d0e7865">Dogidog had very much money and he bought two horses to carry the sacks of silver to his house. When he got near to the town,
he tied <span class="pageno"><a id="d0e7867"></a>Page 201</span>his horses and went to tell his mother to go and ask to buy the good house from the rich man. &#8220;How can you buy?&#8221; said the
rich man, &#8220;when you have no money?&#8221; Then his mother went home and the man went to get two sacks of money to send to the rich
man. When the rich man saw so much money, he said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; for the money was in sacks and was not counted. Then Dogidog went
to live in the good house and the rich man still had no house, so he had no where to go when the rain came.

my <i>poncho</i> on you.&#8221; When he has it on, no one can see him.<a id="d0e7877src" href="#d0e7877" class="noteref">16</a> &#8220;See if I really can see you in my <i>poncho</i>.&#8221; The man took the <i>poncho</i> and put it on, then the spirit could not see him any more, because the cloth made him invisible. Then the man went home.
When he reached there, he said to his wife, &#8220;Wife, where am I now?&#8221; She cried because she thought him dead. He said, &#8220;Do not
cry, for I am not dead, but I have received a <i>poncho</i> which makes me invisible.&#8221; The man took off his <i>poncho</i> and embraced his wife, which made his wife laugh at him, for she knew then that her husband was powerful.

<p id="d0e7901">A fisherman went to catch fish with his throw net. While he was fishing, a big bird, Banog, saw him. It seized the man, put
him on its back and flew away. It lighted on a very big tree in the forest. In the thicket there was a nest with two small
Banog in it.

</p>
<p id="d0e7903">After the bird had put the man near the nest, it flew away again, and the nestlings wished to eat the man, but he defended
himself so they could not eat him. He took one in each hand and jumped from the tree, and the young birds broke his fall so
that he was not hurt. The man was much frightened by the things which had happened to him, and he ran to his home. When he
arrived home, he told with tears what had happened to him. His family were very happy over his return, and made him promise
not to go alone again to fish.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
